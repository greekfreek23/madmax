Friendly and respectful crew\n7. We requested recycling of the leaded glass window from old garage and they did an excellent installation.\n7. When Menards damaged garage doors on delivery, Jake provided temporary barriers to get us through the winter.\n\nWe will definitely be using Jake for future projects - highly recommend!",

          "text": "We recently worked with Jake at J. Henry Construction and could not have been happier.  We contracted him to replace the 60+ year old kitchen and kicked around the idea for quite some time.  Price and quality were a big consideration because the amount of what we wanted to do was extensive.  We wanted to remove a load bearing wall and open up the kitchen to the rest of the house, move a closet, add a pocket door, replace electric and two windows, and install new cabinetry and flooring.\nBecause this was such a large project, we had quotes done from multiple contractors.  Having just done a living room project the year before it was important to me that the contractor did the majority of the work themselves. This was because the last project sat unworked and empty while we waited for subcontractors to come in and complete their sections.  Since a family of 5 relies so heavily on a kitchen I was looking for a contractor that could control the schedule and do it quickly.  Jake reassured me that all the work would be done by himself and would be complete in 4-5 weeks.  His price was considerably lower than our other quotes and he presented me with an itemized quote that addressed all the items I wanted included.  He started on time and finished on time as promised without issue.\nWe worked out all the details and stayed with relatives while Jake started because of the impact the demo would have to our home.  While we were out, he taped off a plastic screen that isolated the kitchen from the rest of the house.  Within three days everything was ripped out down to the 2x4\u2019s and the load bearing wall was removed and the unilam support beam installed.  Our neighbor sent us pictures and I couldn\u2019t believe how much work had been done.  You could see all the way up into the attic from our kitchen!\nIn the two weeks we were away, all the demo, structural work, electric was replaced, new insulation replaced, permit inspection completed and drywall went up.  Its important to note the level of communication Jake maintained during all this was high.  Our drawings showed six can lights and two pendant lights that looked fine on paper, but the 6th can light would have been too close to one of the pendants to look right.  When Jake realized this, he called me promptly, explained it to me and recommended we remove it from the plan.  I think a lot of contractors would have just installed everything per the drawing but Jake took the time to make sure it was going to look right and we were completely happy. It\u2019s clear the Jake truly cares about the quality and appearance of his work.\nThere were so many little things that Jake and his partner did that impressed me along the way.  One of the items that impressed me was an issue with an exhaust vent we moved from the sidewall through the roof.  They patched up the hole and found some old paint in my garage and painted it over without prompting. That\u2019s going above and beyond!\nAnother impressive measure was the dust control.  This was a huge renovation in the middle of our house.  As mentioned, Jake put up plastic to control it but a few times when they were sanding the drywall they grabbed our floor mop and whipped up the floor in a walkway area all without asking.  Things like this just made me feel like they cared for the work they were doing. We were not only happy with the work but able to function in our home despite the mess as it was all being worked on.\nThe work that Jake did was fantastic.  Everything is neat, clean and professional looking.  I really have no complaints at all.  As we are \u201cmoving in\u201d I am looking things over to see if there are any punch list items to address.  I have no issues to add to a punch list and am so happy with this long-awaited project that I plan to use J. Henry exclusively on any remaining projects in my house.  Because of the level of communication, quality of work and speed of progress I highly recommend J. Henry Construction to anyone looking for a contractor.  This is undoubtedly a 5 out of 5 star review.",
