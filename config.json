From scheduling the appointment to finalizing payment, the whole process was quick & easy.  We only had to wait a few days for a routine appointment and Jeremy, the tech who responded to our home, was very friendly & professional.  He completed the work in a fraction of the time we expected, updated me on the status of the septic system & answered all my questions.  For their professionalism & courteous customer service, I absolutely recommend AJ?s!! joey watters joey watters a year ago M Love M Love a year ago Super nice folks that did a great job. We're moving into a new home and they were quick with scheduling, they call back when they miss your call and they show up on time and ready to help. We had some confusion with the sellers on the exact location of the tank and they were kind enough to work with our real estate agent and came back out shortly to get everything taken care of. Highly recommended. Susan Susan a year ago They were quick to respond.  We set a date but they were not sure what time they would be able to get to me. I work 30 minutes away so ( I believe it was Jeremy) contacted me by phone telling me he was heading to my house and understood that I worked 30 minutes away. We discussed what needed to completed. He stated he would call me back when he was finishing up to give me time to drive home.  I was contacted as told.  When I arrived we discussed everything, all my questions were answered and I was extremely pleased with the job and the information. I would highly recommend AJ's septic to anyone especially at a time when it is very difficult to get anyone to call you back or to actually show up to do the work.  Jeremy did a wonderful job. Positive Responsiveness, Punctuality, Quality, Professionalism, Value mystie mcglone mystie mcglone a year ago When we noticed some stinky water at the edge of our yard we called another service first who quoted us astronomical amounts to cut up our concrete and replace field lines. AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it. Thank you guys so much for all the help and the smiling faces while doing such a dirty job and in this awful heat! Positive Responsiveness, Quality, Professionalism"

We were having our crawlspace encapsulated and the contractor needed to have the old drain plugged. Two hours later Spencer called to let me know he had it done and the contractor was back to work. I have had many experiences with tradesmen over the years. This, by far, was the best. I would never use another plumber besides Marble City! Thank you for trusting us with your home and we appreciate the review! The pleasure was mine!"
