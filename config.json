Jarrett arrived the next day exactly at the appointed time.  He had everything he needed to compete the task with him.  He explained to me why the original configuration of discharge piping (dishwasher as well as the garbage disposal) were not optimal and changed them to both look and function better.  He also installed a new garbage disposal.  All of this was completed in less than 1.5 hours and at an expense that was much less than I had anticipated (I've lived at this location over thirty years and had other plumbing issues).  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with Anything Plumbing and they are in my contacts folder.  Jarrett will be coming back in the near future to replace an old Shower valve for me.",

He only repaired what he needed to and the cost was contained.  I know that if he wanted to be shady he could have been.  The opportunity was there, but I really am thankful that honest guys like Jaritt are out there.\n\nOn the technical side of details, my outdoor hose bib was leaking and has been since the house was purchased last year.  The home inspector identified high water psi, and also the leaking hose bib.  The inspectors said you should probably request a pressure regulator on your house, it is very high.  I decided not to request a pressure regulator but I did request the hose bib be fixed.  Long story short is, it was not fixed.\n\nAs it got closer to winter I started worrying about water freezing around the wet ground where it leaks and then messing up my foundation so I called Jaritt.\n\nAt the end of the service Jaritt tells me that he did not need to install a psi regulator because the psi was normal now and then explained that the city had fixed the issue in my neighborhood.  So there was opportunity there to jack the price.  But he was honest and I am appreciative.  Definitely recommend.",

He diagnosed my problem--a broken pipe in my yard that was showing no obvious signs on the surface--dug 3.5' down,  and repaired the damage.  He was courteous, respectful, and made me feel I could trust him.  I'll use him again.  I recommend him without reservation.",

He did a great job despite several issues that made the job difficult and unique. He remained patient with changes I made mid-way through the job and made several trips to pick up materials needed.  He was very polite and patient and was very flexible with his schedule to accommodate me. He stayed within budget which was very reasonable.",
