AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it.

AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it. Thank you guys so much for all the help and the smiling faces while doing such a dirty job and in this awful heat!",

They put up fresh paint on the walls, crown molding, chair rail molding, and they regrouted the floor. They also put up a new light over the dining table and a new sink for the kitchen. They also sanded all of the cabinets and gave them some new paint and new fixtures, not to mention the curtain rods and curtains that they put up in the dining area. I could not be more happy! They use such care! My kitchen and dining area are now so beautiful that I want to show it off all the time! You would definitely never be unpleased with the work from James and Kaleigh!",

They dug up and replaced my crushed field lines then install a new header pipe. Not to mention they charged me HUNDREDS less than anyone else around here! They really took pride in their work and made sure it was done right before they left my house.\nI guarantee you, there?s not another septic company around here that will work to fix your problem from sun down to sun up on a Friday night! Thanks again Jason and Krystal!!\n\nPlease share this post if you can, Help spread the word about this great company!",

The other company had already started the steps in our process, and in the meantime Barnett called me back and was ready to send someone out the Same day. Barnett had worked me in, and she gave me an estimate on labor and cost that seemed fair.    If I have needs in the future, I will contact Barnett plumbing.

The other company had already started the steps in our process, and in the meantime Barnett called me back and was ready to send someone out the Same day. Barnett had worked me in, and she gave me an estimate on labor and cost that seemed fair.    If I have needs in the future, I will contact Barnett plumbing.

He was able to pinpoint the issue within about 15 minutes and had it fixed roughly 45 minutes later.

And a literal wealth of knowledge?I have never learned so much about septic systems and I owned a septic home for 10 years prior to this one.\n\nFor awareness, we bought our home nearly a year and a half ago and have had sporadic septic issues ever since. We used a different company to pump once and they didn?t even reinstall caps properly.\n\nOne call to Miss Sandy and not only did her team respond to pump immediately ? she personally showed up to discuss our concerns. Then, she took it upon herself to find our original septic approval plans, theorize potential causes for our issues, and give us advice/a way forward. She isn?t coming in to make radical, costly repair suggestions, she is truly coming in to get to the root of the issue through the best means possible.\n\nLong and short, she isn?t in the business to make a quick buck on her costumer ? it?s the exact opposite.

And a literal wealth of knowledge?I have never learned so much about septic systems and I owned a septic home for 10 years prior to this one.\n\nFor awareness, we bought our home nearly a year and a half ago and have had sporadic septic issues ever since. We used a different company to pump once and they didn?t even reinstall caps properly.\n\nOne call to Miss Sandy and not only did her team respond to pump immediately ? she personally showed up to discuss our concerns. Then, she took it upon herself to find our original septic approval plans, theorize potential causes for our issues, and give us advice/a way forward. She isn?t coming in to make radical, costly repair suggestions, she is truly coming in to get to the root of the issue through the best means possible.\n\nLong and short, she isn?t in the business to make a quick buck on her costumer ? it?s the exact opposite. She truly values and cares about each person she?s called to aid and will exhaust every viable effort with the least amount of cost and disruption. She is clearly driven by morality, integrity and hard work.

Blake showed me the possible causes of the leak, and then provided me with different options for the repair. He gave me a reasonable price, so we scheduled the job. He arrived ON TIME and was ready to get to work thinking the whole faucet would need to be replaced and the tile would need to be cut out. Once he started the job, he was HONEST and explained that some simple parts were all that were needed to repair the leak which LOWERED the cost significantly. He is organized, and the invoice was easy to pay right then by credit card with an instant digital receipt for my records.",

Jonathan at Machen did return my call and said to call Cochran Brothers. I am so glad I did! He came out the very next morning at 8:30 and said it was the toilet tank upstairs. He replaced the toilet that same morning. We will always use Cochran for our plumbing problems.\nAnother handyman had looked upstairs and wanted to tear out the tile wall. I am so glad we didn't do that! It's best to call a licensed plumber and I recommend Cochran Brothers.",

Blake showed me the possible causes of the leak, and then provided me with different options for the repair. He gave me a reasonable price, so we scheduled the job. He arrived ON TIME and was ready to get to work thinking the whole faucet would need to be replaced and the tile would need to be cut out. Once he started the job, he was HONEST and explained that some simple parts were all that were needed to repair the leak which LOWERED the cost significantly. He is organized, and the invoice was easy to pay right then by credit card with an instant digital receipt for my records.",

I tried to find someone who could come soon to find the leak and fix it. Many plumbers do not return calls or are booked out for days. Jonathan at Machen did return my call and said to call Cochran Brothers. I am so glad I did! He came out the very next morning at 8:30 and said it was the toilet tank upstairs. He replaced the toilet that same morning. We will always use Cochran for our plumbing problems.\nAnother handyman had looked upstairs and wanted to tear out the tile wall. I am so glad we didn't do that! It's best to call a licensed plumber and I recommend Cochran Brothers.",

Gave the estimate and told me to let him know when  my gas stove arrived and he would come back and get the job done. By the time I could get the stove, it was the day before Thanksgiving, and we had really thought it would be here the Monday before....but, hey, I had bought an electric stove NEW and it did not work. That kind of thing runs in the Fowler family! I called him to let him know it was here, and he already had jobs lined up--good thing--and a planned fishing trip--good thing--he had fun! He came after the trip, and I am one happy camper! I have the best stove and even better,  I have the best plumber in town! Allen, you know I had to mention the fishing trip!!! All is well in the Ledbetter home now. Cooking with gas and loving it! Allen, Allen, he our man, if he can't do it ,no one can!!!",

They had to do a bit more work than just a standard pumping but still were willing to stick to the original quoted price.

Eden called me right back and walked us through what to do until he comes tomorrow.  In my panic, I even forgot I can turn the water off for the house. He walked us through that and stopped the bathroom from flooding. I am so grateful to him and look forward to having him back here.

I was told that any plumbing service could inspect and provide the clearance letter needed for selling the home. Thanks to my realtor for doing the leg work and calling different plumbing companies, he gave me Delta's number, and because I had used them in the past I felt comfortable scheduling the inspection for my father's home.\n\nCalling and speaking with Ms. Opal to set up the appointment went without a hitch as she was so very courteous and took the time to answer my questions and was very detailed in the information that she needed as well as the work that would be performed. She even sent a follow up email to let me know that she received my signed authorization form that I emailed back to her....I didn't even have to call and ask....WOW.\n\nThe pleasant experience didn't stop there, Mr. Trace called me once he arrived to the property and then called me back to let me know the results of the inspection. Because I was out of town taking care of my mother, Mr. Trace could have told me anything, but yet he was honest to confirm that the tank was in very good condition and didn't need any service.\n\nThank you to both Ms. Opal and Mr. Trace for your awesome customer service, your attention to detail, and keeping the customer top of mind!!

I was told that any plumbing service could inspect and provide the clearance letter needed for selling the home. Thanks to my realtor for doing the leg work and calling different plumbing companies, he gave me Delta's number, and because I had used them in the past I felt comfortable scheduling the inspection for my father's home.\n\nCalling and speaking with Ms. Opal to set up the appointment went without a hitch as she was so very courteous and took the time to answer my questions and was very detailed in the information that she needed as well as the work that would be performed. She even sent a follow up email to let me know that she received my signed authorization form that I emailed back to her....I didn't even have to call and ask....WOW.\n\nThe pleasant experience didn't stop there, Mr. Trace called me once he arrived to the property and then called me back to let me know the results of the inspection. Because I was out of town taking care of my mother, Mr. Trace could have told me anything, but yet he was honest to confirm that the tank was in very good condition and didn't need any service.\n\nThank you to both Ms. Opal and Mr. Trace for your awesome customer service, your attention to detail, and keeping the customer top of mind!! Awesome!",

Blake has always been very sweet and patient explaining everything to me. He not only found a rare part for my shower due to old pipes but made sure to give me the part info should I ever need another, but his company also came out to my house two days after Christmas to fix a busted pipe as planned but they also fixed my sink as well that they were not told about during the call and showed no irritation with this. So many other times they have come out due to old pipes that they have always gone above and beyond for my family. Highly recommend Hobbs Plumbing for any and all plumbing needs, They are amazing!",

I was out searching for a plumber to do some repairs at a rental property of mine . On my way home about to end my search for that today, I saw a Hobbs Plumbing Van in a stores parking lot . As I pulled into the parking  lot this young man walked out, I explained my situation to him(Bryan), he said yes we can take care of that for you. This company , were professional, diagnosed the problem quickly, and finished the job in a short amount of time. Thank you again Hobbs Plumbing LLC, for doing such a GREAT job.",

Setting up the appointment was very easy, thanks to Brittany, who was so pleasant, helpful and efficient.  Brian arrived at their home and the pleasant experience continued.  He was also so nice and professional and got the job done! Trying to find the right plumber to get the job done correctly can be stressful.  Hobbs Plumbing got the job done, with no stress for me.  I'm grateful.",

I have had to call them multiple times for different things going on in my older house and they have come and fixed everything extremely quickly. Blake has always been very sweet and patient explaining everything to me. He not only found a rare part for my shower due to old pipes but made sure to give me the part info should I ever need another, but his company also came out to my house two days after Christmas to fix a busted pipe as planned but they also fixed my sink as well that they were not told about during the call and showed no irritation with this. So many other times they have come out due to old pipes that they have always gone above and beyond for my family. Highly recommend Hobbs Plumbing for any and all plumbing needs, They are amazing!",

Sadly, it is a major problem that we won't get fixed until we absolutely have no choice but to do so, in the future. This is at a house that we just bought in another neighborhood. Anyway, Jason and his partner were just the best!!!   Unrelated to drains, my husband was trying to pick at a mound of concrete that the former owners poured onto the driveway. They got out their jack hammer like tool and helped him out before they left.",

They replaced a hot water heater (job 1) and replaced the cartridges in both of my bathtub faucets (job 2).  Both faucets are working perfectly now and we have plenty of hot water. Their pricing is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the best thing about them is their willingness to work with your schedule and punctuality. For both jobs, I asked them to come on a specific date. They can on the date requested and were here shortly after 8:00.  This is a drastic change from my previous plumber who was totally unreliable.\n\nJason also did not mind me standing over his shoulder and asking questions. He even stayed a couple of extra minutes to make sure that one faucet stopped dripping.\n\nHis prices are reasonable.  He is *extremely* fair with his pricing.\n\nHe is also very helpful with general information without charging for just a 5 minute conversation.\n\nEDIT: I just used him for a third job.  He again was very punctual which was amazing given we are in the middle of a very hard freeze.  His price for today's job was more than fair.\n\nI highly recommend Jason?s Drain Service.",

Sadly, it is a major problem that we won't get fixed until we absolutely have no choice but to do so, in the future. This is at a house that we just bought in another neighborhood. Anyway, Jason and his partner were just the best!!!   Unrelated to drains, my husband was trying to pick at a mound of concrete that the former owners poured onto the driveway. They got out their jack hammer like tool and helped him out before they left.",

They replaced a hot water heater (job 1) and replaced the cartridges in both of my bathtub faucets (job 2).  Both faucets are working perfectly now and we have plenty of hot water. Their pricing is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the best thing about them is their willingness to work with your schedule and punctuality. For both jobs, I asked them to come on a specific date. They can on the date requested and were here shortly after 8:00.  This is a drastic change from my previous plumber who was totally unreliable.\n\nJason also did not mind me standing over his shoulder and asking questions. He even stayed a couple of extra minutes to make sure that one faucet stopped dripping.\n\nHis prices are reasonable.  He is *extremely* fair with his pricing.\n\nHe is also very helpful with general information without charging for just a 5 minute conversation.\n\nEDIT: I just used him for a third job.  He again was very punctual which was amazing given we are in the middle of a very hard freeze.  His price for today's job was more than fair.\n\nI highly recommend Jason?s Drain Service.",

He has been very helpful in suggesting changes to the approach on the repairs (I feel he saved us quite a bit) and also things we weren't aware of that should be addressed before larger repairs are necessary. John was very thorough and detail oriented with the work performed, and again, we were happy with the quality and results.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend John and his team.",

The board he originally brought did not match exactly so he worked with a fellow contractor to find the exact piece (at no extra charge to us) and made the repair/replacement in a timely manner. He and his assistant did a fantastic job and you cannot even tell where the old boards end and the new boards start, perfect color matching and craftsmanship.

He is the only contractor i will ever use-it is rare to find someone whom you can tell them what u want and just let them go-no need to even touch base thru the process, he gets it handled-i even trust him to select colors/styles for me when im not available to do it.

He is the only contractor i will ever use-it is rare to find someone whom you can tell them what u want and just let them go-no need to even touch base thru the process, he gets it handled-i even trust him to select colors/styles for me when im not available to do it. You def will not be disappointed with your experience with Lord?s Plumbing (Chet Smith).",

The man that did the repair reassured me that he was going to do all he could to get it taken care of as soon as possible, because he understands I have a small child at home and being without water isn't an option.\n\nThis was my first experience having to use a plumber but they have def won my business for life.

My home warranty company set up my appointment with Mikes.\n\nNot only were they fast at making it to my house they were lightning fast fixing the pipe!  The man that did the repair reassured me that he was going to do all he could to get it taken care of as soon as possible, because he understands I have a small child at home and being without water isn't an option.\n\nThis was my first experience having to use a plumber but they have def won my business for life.

He assured me that he could help me. After investigation, he discovered that my tank was NOT under the drive. He serviced the tank and it is now operating properly.

The job consisted of replacing the entire sewer line running around the house to the city tap at the road. This was a very extensive job given the length of run, proximity to two enormous oak trees (within 15 ft) and the age of the house/sewer (1948). He beat two other companies in price by alot which was initially alarming due to the complexity. He spent all day battling roots, antiquated sewage design and the sheer depth of the trench needed for such a long run. We had good flow the first day and didn't have to leave for showers that night. He capped off the cleanouts by 9 the next morning and was technically done. We also had a preexisting issue with a bathroom sink which was not in the scope of the job we agreed on, yet he came in, troubleshot the issue and determined that it couldn't be fixed immediately due to an unrelated issue.\n\nGlen truly does fantastic, affordable work in a timely and transparent manner. He will get the job done right.",

Finally i got someone to come out, but he decided he couldn't get into the tight end of the crawl space.  He refered us to Glen. We were told that Glen was good at getting into tight small places, and he was indead. Glen was very thorough and actually found that the leak was inside an access panel in the house the whole time. I highly recommend Glen at Southside Plumbing. He was even very comfortable with my dogs. Thank you Glen!",

The job consisted of replacing the entire sewer line running around the house to the city tap at the road. This was a very extensive job given the length of run, proximity to two enormous oak trees (within 15 ft) and the age of the house/sewer (1948). He beat two other companies in price by alot which was initially alarming due to the complexity. He spent all day battling roots, antiquated sewage design and the sheer depth of the trench needed for such a long run. We had good flow the first day and didn't have to leave for showers that night. He capped off the cleanouts by 9 the next morning and was technically done. We also had a preexisting issue with a bathroom sink which was not in the scope of the job we agreed on, yet he came in, troubleshot the issue and determined that it couldn't be fixed immediately due to an unrelated issue.\n\nGlen truly does fantastic, affordable work in a timely and transparent manner. He will get the job done right.",

I became very discouraged when I began calling plumbing company's and they didn't answer, or told me they would call back and didn't. Finally i got someone to come out, but he decided he couldn't get into the tight end of the crawl space.  He refered us to Glen. We were told that Glen was good at getting into tight small places, and he was indead. Glen was very thorough and actually found that the leak was inside an access panel in the house the whole time. I highly recommend Glen at Southside Plumbing. He was even very comfortable with my dogs. Thank you Glen!",

I called several plumbers and someone recommended Nick with Veterans. I called him and he answered on Christmas Day and said he could send someone out the next day. Every other plumber was Tuesday or Wednesday the earliest. They showed up early too and the value compared to what I have paid before was unbeatable. I had to ask Nick if the price was correct before I paid, as it was the best price I have seen in sometime. I am so glad I received this recommendation and they will definitely be my new plumbers of choice going forward!",

I called several plumbers and someone recommended Nick with Veterans. I called him and he answered on Christmas Day and said he could send someone out the next day. Every other plumber was Tuesday or Wednesday the earliest. They showed up early too and the value compared to what I have paid before was unbeatable. I had to ask Nick if the price was correct before I paid, as it was the best price I have seen in sometime. I am so glad I received this recommendation and they will definitely be my new plumbers of choice going forward!",
