Not only was he quick to figure it out but he had my pressure regulator valve replaced and the hot water heater leak repaired in just under 2 hours.

In the past, I read many favorable reviews about Jarrett and Anything Plumbing from a web-site called \"My Neighborhood\".  I decided to call Anything Plumbing and give them a try.  Jarrett arrived the next day exactly at the appointed time.  He had everything he needed to compete the task with him.  He explained to me why the original configuration of discharge piping (dishwasher as well as the garbage disposal) were not optimal and changed them to both look and function better.  He also installed a new garbage disposal.  All of this was completed in less than 1.5 hours and at an expense that was much less than I had anticipated (I've lived at this location over thirty years and had other plumbing issues).  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with Anything Plumbing and they are in my contacts folder.  Jarrett will be coming back in the near future to replace an old Shower valve for me.",

He only repaired what he needed to and the cost was contained.  I know that if he wanted to be shady he could have been.  The opportunity was there, but I really am thankful that honest guys like Jaritt are out there.\n\nOn the technical side of details, my outdoor hose bib was leaking and has been since the house was purchased last year.  The home inspector identified high water psi, and also the leaking hose bib.  The inspectors said you should probably request a pressure regulator on your house, it is very high.  I decided not to request a pressure regulator but I did request the hose bib be fixed.  Long story short is, it was not fixed.\n\nAs it got closer to winter I started worrying about water freezing around the wet ground where it leaks and then messing up my foundation so I called Jaritt.\n\nAt the end of the service Jaritt tells me that he did not need to install a psi regulator because the psi was normal now and then explained that the city had fixed the issue in my neighborhood.  So there was opportunity there to jack the price.  But he was honest and I am appreciative.  Definitely recommend.",

Not only was he quick to figure it out but he had my pressure regulator valve replaced and the hot water heater leak repaired in just under 2 hours. I wouldn't hesitate to call him again in the future with any plumbing needs. Thanks Jarrett!",

In the past, I read many favorable reviews about Jarrett and Anything Plumbing from a web-site called \"My Neighborhood\".  I decided to call Anything Plumbing and give them a try.  Jarrett arrived the next day exactly at the appointed time.  He had everything he needed to compete the task with him.  He explained to me why the original configuration of discharge piping (dishwasher as well as the garbage disposal) were not optimal and changed them to both look and function better.  He also installed a new garbage disposal.  All of this was completed in less than 1.5 hours and at an expense that was much less than I had anticipated (I've lived at this location over thirty years and had other plumbing issues).  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with Anything Plumbing and they are in my contacts folder.  Jarrett will be coming back in the near future to replace an old Shower valve for me.",

He only repaired what he needed to and the cost was contained.  I know that if he wanted to be shady he could have been.  The opportunity was there, but I really am thankful that honest guys like Jaritt are out there.\n\nOn the technical side of details, my outdoor hose bib was leaking and has been since the house was purchased last year.  The home inspector identified high water psi, and also the leaking hose bib.  The inspectors said you should probably request a pressure regulator on your house, it is very high.  I decided not to request a pressure regulator but I did request the hose bib be fixed.  Long story short is, it was not fixed.\n\nAs it got closer to winter I started worrying about water freezing around the wet ground where it leaks and then messing up my foundation so I called Jaritt.\n\nAt the end of the service Jaritt tells me that he did not need to install a psi regulator because the psi was normal now and then explained that the city had fixed the issue in my neighborhood.  So there was opportunity there to jack the price.  But he was honest and I am appreciative.  Definitely recommend.",

After the first company showed and tried to upcharge for unnecessary work, after the second company showed up and damaged the septic tank and lid by dropping tye lid into the tank and lied about it Pumped, I contacted Charles Pickle Sepric Tank Service. These guys knew exactly what they were doing and were honest and upfront the entire process. They pumped and inspected septic tank! No upcharges no dishonesty! They maintained communication at all times. They arrived on schedule. Not only did they pump and inspect, these guys repaired the damaged cause by the previous companies. Thank you to Crystal, Justin, Jeremy and everyone involved. I highly recommend!",
