We're moving into a new home and they were quick with scheduling, they call back when they miss your call and they show up on time and ready to help. We had some confusion with the sellers on the exact location of the tank and they were kind enough to work with our real estate agent and came back out shortly to get everything taken care of. Highly recommended. Susan Susan a year ago They were quick to respond.  We set a date but they were not sure what time they would be able to get to me. I work 30 minutes away so ( I believe it was Jeremy) contacted me by phone telling me he was heading to my house and understood that I worked 30 minutes away. We discussed what needed to completed. He stated he would call me back when he was finishing up to give me time to drive home.  I was contacted as told.  When I arrived we discussed everything, all my questions were answered and I was extremely pleased with the job and the information. I would highly recommend AJ's septic to anyone especially at a time when it is very difficult to get anyone to call you back or to actually show up to do the work.  Jeremy did a wonderful job. Positive Responsiveness, Punctuality, Quality, Professionalism, Value mystie mcglone mystie mcglone a year ago When we noticed some stinky water at the edge of our yard we called another service first who quoted us astronomical amounts to cut up our concrete and replace field lines. AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it. Thank you guys so much for all the help and the smiling faces while doing such a dirty job and in this awful heat! Positive Responsiveness, Quality, Professionalism"

I feel bad I didn?t ask their names but he would not take payment for pumping my tank, saying they were in the area. In my 15 years in Alabama I think this is the most helpful company I have dealt with. I am going to order the pump with 100% confidence, knowing how knowledgeable and reliable the people installing it will be! Tommie J Goggans III Tommie J Goggans III I can not say enough good things about AJ's Septic Services. We have used them over the years at three different homes and the work is always done properly and professionally. They are a trustworthy, reliable, and fair family business that still believes that their word is their bond. They always treat my home as if it were their own. Positive Responsiveness, Punctuality, Quality, Professionalism, Value B Campbell B Campbell Very friendly, honest, and reliable! Used them 3 times and will not use any other services. Their employee, Jeremy, was very polite and courteous. He got the job done rather fast and answered any questions I had"
