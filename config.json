We had heard great things about their work and professionalism and after reading such high reviews we did not even get a second bid. With reviews like that we knew they had to be doing a great job at what they do. Our job was dirt work over existing field lines and laying drainage pipe from our gutters to divert water from our house. Drew was the young man sent to do our work and all I can say is WOW, what a nice person he is. He is a perfectionist at his job and strives to do his best work for you and wants you to be pleased with the work you are paying for. When we called about the job they were very prompt in getting back with us.  Customer service is a high priority in their business. Highly recommend them to anyone.",

He stated he would call me back when he was finishing up to give me time to drive home.  I was contacted as told.  When I arrived we discussed everything, all my questions were answered and I was extremely pleased with the job and the information. I would highly recommend AJ's septic to anyone especially at a time when it is very difficult to get anyone to call you back or to actually show up to do the work.  Jeremy did a wonderful job.",

AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it.

We had heard great things about their work and professionalism and after reading such high reviews we did not even get a second bid. With reviews like that we knew they had to be doing a great job at what they do. Our job was dirt work over existing field lines and laying drainage pipe from our gutters to divert water from our house. Drew was the young man sent to do our work and all I can say is WOW, what a nice person he is. He is a perfectionist at his job and strives to do his best work for you and wants you to be pleased with the work you are paying for. When we called about the job they were very prompt in getting back with us.  Customer service is a high priority in their business. Highly recommend them to anyone.",

AJ's came & pumped our septic tank, told us our field lines were working great and that a possible leaky toilet was most likely the culprit. These guys were so nice, on time, professional, and so helpful. They were quick to offer alternative solutions to help fix the issue rather than just charging us money to fix something that didn't need it.

This is a local family business that prides themself on being proficient, friendly and punctual. They have pumped my tank more than 3 times and replaced the lines coming from the tank. They guided me through the process and made sure to explain everything so that I completely understood what was going on. After installing new lines they spread grass seed and fertilizer so that my yard could get back to normal. The bottom line is this... I can't imagine getting better service from anyone else. They come highly recommended for a reason. Thanks Tina and everyone on the All-Pro Team!",

They came to our house two years ago and cleaned out our septic and it was the best job that we have had because we were obviously having septic issues. Cut to January 2023 and their son came out here and did such a phenomenal job that I wanted to tip him. Today, February 8 we are still having septic issues that are not in their control and they came out and gave me a discount because they feel bad and it?s not their fault! They are amazing!! The customer service and promptness in an emergency situation exceeds all expectations!",

We recently bought a home and were told the tank had been pumped a year ago but the previous owners could not provide any info on when it was down or who did it. We didn?t have issues with our system but wanted to have it inspected/pumped just to make sure it was cared for. This team was able to get out to pump it 3 days after our call (it was not an emergency so I was more than happy to wait) they showed up early in the day and got the whole job completed within an hour. They showed me the tank after it was uncovered and were told it looks like it has NEVER been pumped! They were all professional and friendly, gave me advice on how to care for the tank life long as I have never had a septic tank before. They explained in great detail what to watch for and how often to have it pumped, they never tried to upsell me even though it would have been easy as I have no idea about anything septic lol they stood firm on their quote they gave me via email and were even reluctant to take a tip because they didn?t feel it was necessary. If you want an honest and friendly company that doesn?t try to milk you for money this is the one to go with! Even though they were very busy they didn?t seem inconvenienced by all of my questions 10/10 recommend",

From Tina (who I?ve learned is the Mom) to her son, Gage who was the guy who came to service our septic system, they were amazing. We moved into a new house a week ago and our septic stopped draining. Gage came out and pumped us and inspected the system. He confirmed it?s not draining. Gave me number to call to have new field lines drawn up then call all pro back to do the service. I have 4 sons and my toddler asks a lot of questions. Gage answered everything. He was very professional and kind. What would usually be a super stressful experience, this company is making me feel confident that it will be fine and they will handle it. Also the pricing!!!! I called 5 different septic companies to get my septic pumped and service and every quote was over 500$ to pump. Some even said it would be another 100$ to dig to be able to pump. My husband is military and dug it before he left the country. All pro came out and after military discount I was only charged 275$ for pumping and inspecting it. If you have septic issues just do yourself a favor and hire All Pro. Photo is my husband thinking he could fix the problem himself ?",

They guided me through the process and made sure to explain everything so that I completely understood what was going on. After installing new lines they spread grass seed and fertilizer so that my yard could get back to normal. The bottom line is this... I can't imagine getting better service from anyone else. They come highly recommended for a reason. Thanks Tina and everyone on the All-Pro Team!",

We recently bought a home and were told the tank had been pumped a year ago but the previous owners could not provide any info on when it was down or who did it. We didn?t have issues with our system but wanted to have it inspected/pumped just to make sure it was cared for. This team was able to get out to pump it 3 days after our call (it was not an emergency so I was more than happy to wait) they showed up early in the day and got the whole job completed within an hour. They showed me the tank after it was uncovered and were told it looks like it has NEVER been pumped! They were all professional and friendly, gave me advice on how to care for the tank life long as I have never had a septic tank before. They explained in great detail what to watch for and how often to have it pumped, they never tried to upsell me even though it would have been easy as I have no idea about anything septic lol they stood firm on their quote they gave me via email and were even reluctant to take a tip because they didn?t feel it was necessary. If you want an honest and friendly company that doesn?t try to milk you for money this is the one to go with! Even though they were very busy they didn?t seem inconvenienced by all of my questions 10/10 recommend",

From Tina (who I?ve learned is the Mom) to her son, Gage who was the guy who came to service our septic system, they were amazing. We moved into a new house a week ago and our septic stopped draining. Gage came out and pumped us and inspected the system. He confirmed it?s not draining. Gave me number to call to have new field lines drawn up then call all pro back to do the service. I have 4 sons and my toddler asks a lot of questions. Gage answered everything. He was very professional and kind. What would usually be a super stressful experience, this company is making me feel confident that it will be fine and they will handle it. Also the pricing!!!! I called 5 different septic companies to get my septic pumped and service and every quote was over 500$ to pump. Some even said it would be another 100$ to dig to be able to pump. My husband is military and dug it before he left the country. All pro came out and after military discount I was only charged 275$ for pumping and inspecting it. If you have septic issues just do yourself a favor and hire All Pro. Photo is my husband thinking he could fix the problem himself ?",

While on the phone, they really tried to diagnose the problem and help me to fix it before they scheduled to come. Well I couldn't fix it, they said they would come out Sunday...I was like ok I can wait...they called me back the next day and said they could come earlier than scheduled...I said great. They came out and examined system, fixed the problem in less than 20 minutes while giving me a SEPTIC 101 class at the same time. I really appreciate the knowledge, professionalism and education provided. Call this company, they will get it done!!!!",
