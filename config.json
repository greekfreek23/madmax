If ever giving a high dollar quote,do yourself a favor and call John for a second opinion.To try and make a long story short: The first plumber I called was awful. He came initially at 8:30 pm for ten minutes and told us we needed thousands of dollars worth of work done. After poor communication and him continuing to no show us, we called John with Steele Plumbing. He came exactly when he said he would, and was done with his work within a few hours. The first plumber falsely exaggerated our plumbing issue. Words cannot express how thankful I am for Steele Plumbing but to try and describe them in a few- Honest, dependable, polite, knowledgeable, punctual, and responsive!"

He installed all our plumbing from tubs, sinks, toilets, shower faucets, garbage disposal and water heater and couldn?t be more happier with the end results. He was patient (construction always has delays), informative (giving us details of what we should, shouldn?t do) and timely (getting it done by the deadlines). We have used him for our personal and business needs as well as referred to many many other people. He?s definitely worth calling for your plumbing needs.Responsiveness, Quality, Professionalism, ValueWater heater installation, Garbage disposal installation, Shower installation, Toilet installation, Faucet installation"
