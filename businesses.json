He’s been there for repairs and to help us with plumbing updates. Most recently he did the plumbing for our home bar. He was fast, professional and knowledgeable about what needed to be done and how to do it with minimal damage to the drywall. We couldn’t be happier. I’m always telling my friends and family about him and I encourage anyone reading this review to call him for all of your plumbing needs. 10 out of 10!",
