Mr. Shawn and his team went above and beyond when they were working to fix the issue with my septic system. They were the first company I ever did business with that did not leave a mess when they finished the job. Mr. Shawn noticed I was a veteran and gave me a discount without even asking. If you are looking for the perfect company to hire for your septic needs, 3rd Generation Septic is the way to go."

Shawn and another person that was with him, called the morning of the appointment, was on time, and took care of it with no problems. After they finished, they asked me to go inside and flush the commodes to be sure the problem with the sluggish flushes were gone. They were! This company is EXCELLENT! My yard was completely the same as before they came. They made sure to cover the ground up just as it was before. There were no marks left in yard, which is great! The guys even gave me advice to do every few months to help aid the break down of the waste in the septic. They were both very professional and respectful! This will be my go to company and I will recommend them at any given chance! Awesome customer service and a fair price for my job needed. Just a great experience from start to finish!  Thank you, 3rd Generation Septic!!"

Specifically told me he had one appointment ahead of me and that he would be at my house around lunchtime!!  It was BEFORE lunchtime when he was sitting in my driveway ready to roll!!!  Shawn and Kyle pulled up already ready to get to work!!  Love this guy and his attitude and willingness to help and get the job done!!!  This is my guy right here from now on!!! My neighbors saw the truck in my yard and I have already slid them his number!!!  This is my guy right here!!!!"

After they finished, they asked me to go inside and flush the commodes to be sure the problem with the sluggish flushes were gone. They were! This company is EXCELLENT! My yard was completely the same as before they came. They made sure to cover the ground up just as it was before. There were no marks left in yard, which is great! The guys even gave me advice to do every few months to help aid the break down of the waste in the septic. They were both very professional and respectful! This will be my go to company and I will recommend them at any given chance! Awesome customer service and a fair price for my job needed. Just a great experience from start to finish!

My yard was completely the same as before they came. They made sure to cover the ground up just as it was before. There were no marks left in yard, which is great! The guys even gave me advice to do every few months to help aid the break down of the waste in the septic. They were both very professional and respectful! This will be my go to company and I will recommend them at any given chance! Awesome customer service and a fair price for my job needed. Just a great experience from start to finish!

Sadly, it is a major problem that we won't get fixed until we absolutely have no choice but to do so, in the future. This is at a house that we just bought in another neighborhood. Anyway, Jason and his partner were just the best!!!   Unrelated to drains, my husband was trying to pick at a mound of concrete that the former owners poured onto the driveway. They got out their jack hammer like tool and helped him out before they left."

They replaced a hot water heater (job 1) and replaced the cartridges in both of my bathtub faucets (job 2).  Both faucets are working perfectly now and we have plenty of hot water. Their pricing is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the best thing about them is their willingness to work with your schedule and punctuality. For both jobs, I asked them to come on a specific date. They can on the date requested and were here shortly after 8:00.  This is a drastic change from my previous plumber who was totally unreliable.\n\nJason also did not mind me standing over his shoulder and asking questions. He even stayed a couple of extra minutes to make sure that one faucet stopped dripping.\n\nHis prices are reasonable.  He is *extremely* fair with his pricing.\n\nHe is also very helpful with general information without charging for just a 5 minute conversation.\n\nEDIT: I just used him for a third job.  He again was very punctual which was amazing given we are in the middle of a very hard freeze.  His price for today's job was more than fair.\n\nI highly recommend Jason’s Drain Service."

They replaced all the polybutylene lines under my sink and installed shut off valves on each line. They installed a new undercounter water filter system and reconnected my dish washer line. These guys did an excellent job and really care about doing an excellent job for the customer. They do things the correct way.

I sent Jared a picture of my old water heater and from his experience he was able to tell me that my water heater had been leaking for quite a while and suggested that it was time to get a new one if I was ready. We set up an appointment and he brought a new electric water heater (better quality and more efficient then lows and Hm dept) and installed it. He made the proper fitting adjustments to my old pipes. He also helped me locate my water meter so that he could turn off the water it was covered in 2 inches of dirt and he dug it out. He is very professional and polite (ma'am).

He fixed the problem promptly and even gave me a few pointers to help me prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nI've seen a few bad reviews from people based on their \"home warranty\" and their repair not being covered.  Whether you dispatch a plumber, electrician, or AC specialist, they can only cover items that your home warranty company lets them cover, based on your contract (that you picked).  People should read their contracts first before taking their frustrations out on a local business.  Cheaper home warranties cover less items, go figure."

Over the past several months and especially during COVID shortages he has provided what seems to be an invaluable resource and that is peace of mind.  I can ask him to resolve anything from replacing a garbage disposal to fixing a fireplace (gas pipe) without having to follow-up with him.  He gets the job done, often goes beyond expectation, and is quick to communicate…even when he just got out of the hospital.

I was told that any plumbing service could inspect and provide the clearance letter needed for selling the home. Thanks to my realtor for doing the leg work and calling different plumbing companies, he gave me Delta's number, and because I had used them in the past I felt comfortable scheduling the inspection for my father's home.\n\nCalling and speaking with Ms. Opal to set up the appointment went without a hitch as she was so very courteous and took the time to answer my questions and was very detailed in the information that she needed as well as the work that would be performed. She even sent a follow up email to let me know that she received my signed authorization form that I emailed back to her....I didn't even have to call and ask....WOW.\n\nThe pleasant experience didn't stop there, Mr. Trace called me once he arrived to the property and then called me back to let me know the results of the inspection. Because I was out of town taking care of my mother, Mr. Trace could have told me anything, but yet he was honest to confirm that the tank was in very good condition and didn't need any service.\n\nThank you to both Ms. Opal and Mr. Trace for your awesome customer service, your attention to detail, and keeping the customer top of mind!! Awesome!"

We had a serious plumbing and called Delta and they were here very quickly since it was an emergency and we didn't want out brand new floor and bathroom ruined because of the back up that was caused from 64 year old cast iorn pipes rusting and breaking apart.    They were here 2 days assessing the job, was here early in the day Wednesday and started the job.  Every piece of dirt was put back into place.....lol .......and the made special care of not tearing up a new baby tree that had just been planted recently.  They doubled checked the water to make sure it was running threw the new pipes properly, had me run water threw the washing machine several times so that everything was flowing correctly and not backing up again.  The speediness and care they gave me was top notch.  Everything they had to do or needed to do they told me first and asked if i wanted to do it and yes we did it.  And I couldn't be happier.  In the past we have used several different plumbers but no one has ever taken the time to explain everything to us and give us the option as to what we wanted to do, and give me the respect I deserve being that its our house and our money.  No pressure or pushing us into a decision we needed to think about it and go over with him on.   I totally recommend Delta Plumbing for any and all plumbing problems they would be the one's I'd call and \"will\" call.  Thank you Jacob for your help, your kindness and concern of what could have happened in the very near future had we not had all those pipes replaced.  Thank you Delta"

He did the plumbing work very quickly and professionally installed a tankless water heater the same day as the estimate. The next day he is out working on my foundation and roof with his brother.

I have been very pleased with Taylor's work, and I plan on going back to Top Notch for any future plumbing work I may need.\n\nUPDATE:  I needed my bathtub drain cleaned out again, and Taylor was the first call I made. I called on a Sunday, planning to leave a voice message for the next day. Taylor returned my call quickly and said he should be able to see me on Tuesday, which was about the time-line I expected. When I received the scheduling message from him a little later, he was able to fit me in on Monday, instead.

They quickly responded, got my estimate, which was way lower than I was expecting, and as soon as I had funds, they scheduled to come out fixed the leak in the ground and bonus fixed my shower without breaking the bank. It only took two hours start to finish. I also want to thank American leak for coming out first thing in the morning to pinpoint the leak so didn't have to dig up flower bed too much."

Buddy and his crew do a great job at a reasonable price. They are courteous, professional, and keep you informed of the project's progress. I have tried other local plumbers in the past, but I learned my lesson quickly. Muddy Buddy's Plumbing is the only plumber's number I have stored in my phone, and the only plumber I will use from now on. I can't recommend Muddy Buddy enough."

Very reasonable rate so he and the young man he had with him, Landon, made the repair immediately. It’s so hard nowadays to find people and companies you can trust who are reliable, trustworthy and honest, but this was a great experience and did not disappoint.

We’re new in the area and didn’t know who to call so we reached out again to the Muddy Buddy crew. At first, Glenda patiently walked me through via phone in finding a solution, but when that didn’t work, Guy dropped his morning plans to help solve our lawn irrigation problem (even though this was not a standard plumbing service). These awesome folks didn’t have to respond on a Sunday morning, but they did and I’m just continually amazed by the people we’ve interacted with here in Huntsville AL, most especially Guy and Glenda for their above and beyond sincerity, and customer care. I know this might be saying much, but these are truly good folks and I have no hesitation referring family and friends to them. Thank you once again guys, proud to say we’re your new lifelong customers—and friends!!"

The pipe was busted under the concrete so Muddy Buddy had to reroute the pipe to another location. A different company came out before and obviously damaged the pipe while trying to get it to drain, and then they did an estimate to reroute the pipes just in case it needed it. Obviously, it needed it after the pipe wall was busted at the first turn. Their price climbed to over $2k in less than 10 minutes by adding in other pipes and parts that had to be replaced (but didnt need to be replaced). Muddy Buddy did the job that needed to be done without replacing good pipes in a few hours that the other company said would take a week, and Muddy Buddy did the job for 1/3 of the price of the other company's estimate and didnt add in other pipes, parts, and days of labor just to make a buck. Good old fashioned service without trying to rip off their customers."

They did so good I had them check some other plumbing things and found out work previously was done improperly and explained exactly what and why it was this way. I called the other company and asked them why and when I explained it to them they didn’t have an answer and wanted to come back out to my house and redo the work properly. I said \"NO\" and called Muddy Buddy back and gave them the work which in turn they fixed everything wrong immediately and at an affordable price. Highly recommend this Company.

He came out, changed a part, and installed a new toilet, for under half of what we were previously quoted.  The work was excellent.  They cleaned up after themselves, and left no mess.

Blake showed me the possible causes of the leak, and then provided me with different options for the repair. He gave me a reasonable price, so we scheduled the job. He arrived ON TIME and was ready to get to work thinking the whole faucet would need to be replaced and the tile would need to be cut out. Once he started the job, he was HONEST and explained that some simple parts were all that were needed to repair the leak which LOWERED the cost significantly. He is organized, and the invoice was easy to pay right then by credit card with an instant digital receipt for my records."

Jonathan at Machen did return my call and said to call Cochran Brothers. I am so glad I did! He came out the very next morning at 8:30 and said it was the toilet tank upstairs. He replaced the toilet that same morning. We will always use Cochran for our plumbing problems.\nAnother handyman had looked upstairs and wanted to tear out the tile wall. I am so glad we didn't do that! It's best to call a licensed plumber and I recommend Cochran Brothers."

Took about an hour and he didn't charge a dime.\n\nCut to the chase, I am so glad I made this call because Jeremy was very timely in his response and in getting the job done. Very knowledgeable and professional with competitive pricing. Definitely our  go-to now for any future plumbing needs. Very highly recommend. 10 stars"

I had had enough.   He was at my home around 6 that same day.  I did not expect that.  He had to redo the plumbing for the dishwasher as it was all wrong and had to take out the wood floor there to get the new one to fit.  The newer dishwashers are way different then the old ones.   It was so a relief having this young man come to our aide.   I will call him for future plumbing issues and will recommend him to others as well.

Not only was he on time, he was actually a bit early. He immediately got to work. He thought initially the septic tank might need pumped, however, on further inspection,  the pipe in the basement had come loose from what was holding it up properly and was now sitting at a downward angle. It wasn't allowing everything to pass through and thus there was a huge clog. Jeremy soon had everything cleaned out, that section of pipe replaced and resealed, and mounted back to the wall properly. He was extremely professional, courteous and I will most definitely call him again should I need anything in the future.\nThank you Jeremy!"

He ended up having to cut into the cabinets to get everything to fit proper and brought up his shop vac to clean up. Cleaned under all my major appliances while he was at it. I later made a comment to watch his step on a flight of stairs because my light was out and he offered to fix that too.\n\nJeremy is the most diligent repair man I've met. He cuts no corners and really goes above and beyond. Highly recommend."

I knew before the very first call to Tristan that the clogged toilet was old and probably just needed to be replaced. But when I had to call him a second time to come unclog the toilet, I knew that it was just time to replace it. I talked to him about installing a new toilet, got a quote, and expected to have to wait at least a week or more before he would be able to get back out to put in the new toilet, but nope! He was back two days later and had the new toilet installed in a little more than an hour! I would not hesitate to recommend him to family, friends, and strangers.

From the initial contact forward, the experience has all been great. John and his team are easy to work with and we have been really pleased with the results.\n\nJohn is both personable and extremely knowledgeable. He has been very helpful in suggesting changes to the approach on the repairs (I feel he saved us quite a bit) and also things we weren't aware of that should be addressed before larger repairs are necessary. John was very thorough and detail oriented with the work performed, and again, we were happy with the quality and results.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend John and his team."

His quote was reasonable for the work required and then we scheduled a time for him to come out and complete the job. The board he originally brought did not match exactly so he worked with a fellow contractor to find the exact piece (at no extra charge to us) and made the repair/replacement in a timely manner. He and his assistant did a fantastic job and you cannot even tell where the old boards end and the new boards start, perfect color matching and craftsmanship. They were on time, courteous, and efficient. We cannot wait to hire John and his team for more projects around our home!"

We initially were going to have our ceiling damage repaired by a guy our friends recommended, but the quote he gave was way over the top and included items we didn’t want fixed. They also did not have the ability to match our plaster design, requiring removal of the entire drywall.\n\nJohn came out within 48 hours of us reaching out was able to give us detailed step by step instructions on what we needed to do to cut down on cost of repairs, and his plasterer Anthony was able to perform a ceiling patch and plaster match, which reduced the overall cost of the project by a significant amount. Anthony was extremely skilled and matched our ceiling pattern perfectly within 2 hours (he patched about a 8x16 foot hole and plastered it). John and his assistant were back out to seal the water stains and paint our ceilings as soon as the plaster dried—they were quick and were able to not drip any ceiling paint on any of our brand new floors, which we certainly would not have been able to do ourselves!\n\nOverall, great customer service, quick repairs,  and great cost! I’ve attached pictures to this post because I’m still amazed that they were able to perfectly match our crazy from the 60’s plaster pattern."

Within 24 hours, they show up when promised and get to work, removing our heater and installing a new one. They were courteous and professional, and our new heater is working great. We appreciate that they were careful not to scratch walls or doors when moving heaters in and out and didn’t leave any mess for us to deal with. We would definitely call them again for plumbing work (in fact, we are already talking about having them come back out to install a whole house water filter system for us). Thanks."

I will never use another plumber and I will spread his name to anybody and everybody that will listen to me and as far as Price, he is way better and fairer than anybody in this business.

Thankfully, Paul and his team are passionate about the services they provide. I have not only received high quality work with top tier customer service but LT Drain and Small Repair also deliver the best for a fair price. I’m quite sure everyone has experienced a business that will take advantage of the customer and attempt to hustle said customer into unnecessary costs. Paul has done 2 jobs for me so far and the 3rd job I requested was an unnecessary one. Instead of taking advantage of me, he let me know what caused the issue and he assured me the 2nd job would take care of said issue. He knows his industry and it turns out that his advice was spot on! Not only has he earned my business but he has also earned my trust! I won’t do business with anyone else in the industry and I am so thankful to have found them!!!"

They also just felt like the most honest of the choices & we felt most comfortable choosing to hire them for the job. Then, when it came time to do the work, they were fast/efficient, friendly, and the repairs (new fittings & access panel) looked fantastic. And when an unexpected problem popped up, causing them to need to work a bit longer, they went above & beyond without adding any extra charges. Definitely plan on using them for any & all future plumbing needs. Hoping this review saves others the time & effort of shopping around. You can’t go wrong with these guys. 👍👍"

After asking for his professional opinion, we decided to go ahead and replace the water heater. Keep in mind, it’s now 430ish on a Friday afternoon. He said he would rather go ahead and start the job as opposed to waiting until Monday. In his words, “I don’t want to leave you with a ticking time bomb.”  The entire job took about four hours to complete. Carter didn’t leave the house until 9 or so when it was all said and done.\n\nI don’t know of many companies that would have done what Carter did.

He was able to clear the clog and made sure it was perfect before he left. I highly recommend him. He has fair prices and does the job quickly and professionally.

He gave me a price that almost knocked me over BECAUSE it was MORE THAN FAIR. (WAY less than the “national average “ to do that kind of job) not only that AFTER he quoted me the price and did the rather large job he fixed a couple of minor problems for me .....he said “it won’t take but a few extra  minutes and it’s no problem ” (he had already been here for a few hours!)  I will be using him for any plumbing needs I have in the future and I highly recommend him. He is knowledgeable, helpful, reasonable, fair, kind, and the quality of his work is excellent."

He openly admitted there *might\" be a 2nd issue, but there would be a different need than he could provide (e.g tile work), so he prepared me for that possible next step. Good news - as of 1 month later I have ZERO evidence of any water and Carter's plumbing work saved the day - and I haven't forked over any $$$ for extra tile/construction work!!!\nFrom a value perspective, I don't have any comparable dollars. That said, he was very transparent how he charged and provided a clear bill. I did not at all feel like he took advantage of the job based upon the work he performed and time he spent. He was quite thorough, and seemingly very honest and transparent in his diagnosis and solution, and quite knowledgeable of his trade!!!\nOn top of his work, he was friendly and courteous. He was dog-friendly and was very affectionate to our sweet Peggy. ♥️\nThank you, Carter, for great work!"

He designed a new vent system so that no pipes would show up through the roof sections at the front of the house. He also created a new water supply system throughout the house using PEX. He even replaced some pvc on our pool pump! Sims gave a lot of great advice along the way and helped us overcome several obstacles in our remodeling. We will be having him return shortly to hook up all of the fixtures as soon as the drywall is complete. Sims is very personable and passionate about doing quality work.

They were able to fit me into the schedule several days sooner than anyone else I talked with, and they were helpful to inform me of known and unknown potential expenses. When the details of a home warranty company came into play, they gave me some input and time to sort out the specifics in order to minimize the cost I had to bear. Nicholas even gave me some great guidance without hesitation on a few smaller plumbing projects I hoped to undertake by myself in the future. When dealing with something as important as water lines, I would much rather hire someone who does quality work than someone who just \"gets it done\" for cheap. Nevertheless, I felt like their service was a solid value and would absolutely call them again. The peace of mind of knowing a licensed pro completed the job and will stand by their work is worth a LOT. I would absolutely recommend S&S and Nicholas especially."

During a leak detection service call, they went so far as to re-caulk certain tub fixtures while outright replacing a rusty old pipe that sent orange water into the bath when turned on. These additional touches weren't part of the service, but Nicholas quickly offered (without our asking) to replace and seal these fixtures as merely part of his visit. After trying other, bigger-name plumbing companies in the area, S&S was clearly the winner. Do yourself a favor and hire these plumbers if you want the job done thoroughly, correctly, and without a price tag that'll make you faint."

Im not looking forward to more plumbing issues in the future but i would easily feel comfortable calling him for all my plumbing. A+"

Jarrett arrived the next day exactly at the appointed time.  He had everything he needed to compete the task with him.  He explained to me why the original configuration of discharge piping (dishwasher as well as the garbage disposal) were not optimal and changed them to both look and function better.  He also installed a new garbage disposal.  All of this was completed in less than 1.5 hours and at an expense that was much less than I had anticipated (I've lived at this location over thirty years and had other plumbing issues).  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with Anything Plumbing and they are in my contacts folder.  Jarrett will be coming back in the near future to replace an old Shower valve for me."

He only repaired what he needed to and the cost was contained.  I know that if he wanted to be shady he could have been.  The opportunity was there, but I really am thankful that honest guys like Jaritt are out there.\n\nOn the technical side of details, my outdoor hose bib was leaking and has been since the house was purchased last year.  The home inspector identified high water psi, and also the leaking hose bib.  The inspectors said you should probably request a pressure regulator on your house, it is very high.  I decided not to request a pressure regulator but I did request the hose bib be fixed.  Long story short is, it was not fixed.\n\nAs it got closer to winter I started worrying about water freezing around the wet ground where it leaks and then messing up my foundation so I called Jaritt.\n\nAt the end of the service Jaritt tells me that he did not need to install a psi regulator because the psi was normal now and then explained that the city had fixed the issue in my neighborhood.  So there was opportunity there to jack the price.  But he was honest and I am appreciative.  Definitely recommend."

Jon also helped me plan some of the details of my faucet placement that I was not thinking about.  Very professional crew.  We could not be happier!"

He took off his shoes before entering my home and he let me know that he had never found a tooth crown in anyone’s kitchen sink. He loosened the cv elbow pipe and poured its contents out in a plastic container and there was my crown. I was so excited because his cost was a lot cheaper than a new crown. He provided me with his business card and I will definitely use his services again and let everyone know how professional he was. He even pet my dog that was anxious and she calmed down barking. The price for his service was very reasonable and he was a kind young man."

I will definitely call them the next time we need a plumber."

My husband recently had a quadruple bypass and was unable to do the installation himself. He called Derrick only to learn Derrick broke his wrist and was not able to do the job but he has a journeyman named John. We coordinated an appointment . John was exceptional! Prompt, very personable and thorough. We are so pleased with the work that was done and the price we paid. If you ever need a plumber we highly recommend Cherokee Services Plumbing!"
