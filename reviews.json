My brother was helping me and we wound up having to cut the retaining ring for the cartridge.  Went several places no luck finding.  Went to Lowes and was told I would be unable to buy just the ring I would have to replace the entire valve which meant calling a plumber.  I went to Wigmans since they are a hardware store and normally carry odd ball things.  The gentleman in plumbing very nice they did not have and suggested I try All American faucet parts.  I traveled there went in and explained what I needed they had it, you made an old lady very happy.  2 Very kind gentlemen.  I purchased the part and thank them so much.  I called Wigmans and thanked the gentleman who helped me and told me to try them.  Great Customer Service."

Both gentlemen were informative and helped me with not only the parts I needed but with advise on how to ensure I was successful on making the repairs.\nI was able to fix my leaking facet last night with their parts and advise.  Spent less than $50 for three parts.   Plumber online quoted $300 plus parts.\nStrongly recommend you taking the time to search them out."
