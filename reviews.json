He’s been there for repairs and to help us with plumbing updates. Most recently he did the plumbing for our home bar. He was fast, professional and knowledgeable about what needed to be done and how to do it with minimal damage to the drywall. We couldn’t be happier. I’m always telling my friends and family about him and I encourage anyone reading this review to call him for all of your plumbing needs. 10 out of 10!"

Barnett had worked me in, and she gave me an estimate on labor and cost that seemed fair.    If I have needs in the future, I will contact Barnett plumbing.

They replaced a hot water heater (job 1) and replaced the cartridges in both of my bathtub faucets (job 2).  Both faucets are working perfectly now and we have plenty of hot water. Their pricing is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the best thing about them is their willingness to work with your schedule and punctuality. For both jobs, I asked them to come on a specific date. They can on the date requested and were here shortly after 8:00.  This is a drastic change from my previous plumber who was totally unreliable.\n\nJason also did not mind me standing over his shoulder and asking questions. He even stayed a couple of extra minutes to make sure that one faucet stopped dripping.\n\nHis prices are reasonable.  He is *extremely* fair with his pricing.\n\nHe is also very helpful with general information without charging for just a 5 minute conversation.\n\nEDIT: I just used him for a third job.  He again was very punctual which was amazing given we are in the middle of a very hard freeze.  His price for today's job was more than fair.\n\nI highly recommend Jason’s Drain Service."

He has done work on the interior and exterior of our older house, AND has upgraded fixtures for us. We couldn't be happier. He is honest, efficient, hard working, and the price point was a relief for us. In a day when it's hard to find service workers who possess both skill and integrity, I HIGHLY recommend Jason, who has both!"

It’s never easy coming out of pocket for major unexpected purchases but when they happens you want someone you can trust. I’ll tell you now why I trust R & D services\nI needed my 30 year old Hvac unit (R22) and furnaces replaced a few weeks ago and it just  happened to be in the middle of one of the hottest summers in recent memory, and decided to get several quotes from companies in the area. Ron the owner of R &D was extremely knowledgeable and was able to assess my situation and give clear guidance on what we needed. Ron was also able to identify potential roadbumps prior to the install and plan for them which none of the other companies mentioned with my unit being in a very small attic space. Ron and his team worked quickly to get my families air back going and the new unit installed and was able to reconfigure the new unit and add addition safety features to Eliminate the possibility of a leaking into my ceiling which was problem in the past. The workmanship was top notch and I never felt pressured or rushed to pull the trigger. If you are needing HVAC service from a fair, honest, and experienced technician please have a conversation with Ron. I can personally guarantee after that conversation you will be more informed and presented with options around your needs as well as feel confident of your decision afterwards."

We had to go through the insurance process since it was storm related and he was professional and kept up with everything for us that needed to be turned into them for our claim. He showed up when he said he would, he was honest in his diagnosis, and he was more than reasonable in his charges. Sometimes when you have folks out there working on your residence they'll leave trash - not Ron. Minus cold air blowing from my vents, I didn't know he was there! I would recommend Ron over and over again. So long as he is in business, he will be the one I call for all my heating/air needs."

We decided it was a better option to replace the entire unit than to replace the compressor. Ron is super friendly and professional. He explained everything to us in detail and answered any questions we had. He and his crew had our system in and operating in one day. I had quotes from a few different businesses, and R&D beat their prices by thousands. One company had quoted me starting at $7,000 more for an inferior unit. R&D provided us with 10 yr warranties on parts and the compressor and 2yrs on services. I feel like R&D provided us with the most value for our money and we now have a top shelf HVAC system professionally installed by a company that knows their trade inside and out. I would recommend R&D heating and air to anyone that needs any kind of HVAC work done."

Chris called today (8/23/2023) stating that he was in the area and could work on our system when he finished with the call he was currently working.  As promised, he called to give us a heads up that he was on his way.  He was courteous and professional.  Got right to work and found that 2 capacitors had blown.  He hooked everything up to monitor the system and noted that the fan wasn't moving as fast as it should have been.  He found that the fan motor was burnt out and this is what caused the capacitors to blow.  He quickly replaced the fan motor and ensured that everything was working properly before he left."

After an extremely negative experience with a different repair technician, we were leery to have anyone else try to help.\n\nI am so glad we kept our appointment with Jeremy! We have been without a dishwasher for about a month and a half due to our last experience with the previous dishwasher repair person. The original repair person told us our dishwasher was not leaking. He stated he was unwilling to pull the dishwasher out from under the counter and we would need to completely remodel our kitchen in order to get the dishwasher out. He also stated he was going to order a part to repair the damage our dishwasher was causing when it leaked. This technician never returned and we never heard from him again. (Thankfully he did not return, due to his complete incompetence, lack of knowledge, and absence of any pride in his workmanship.)\n\nJeremy was easily able to not only repair our dishwasher, he simply pulled it out from under the counter, connected the hose that was disconnected and causing the leak, and stayed to test the dishwasher more than once to be sure there were no remaining leaks or anything he may have missed.\n\nThe dishwasher is fully functional and we are incredibly grateful! We highly, highly recommend Jeremy for any service issues!!\n\nJeremy is highly-skilled at his craft and takes pride in his workmanship. In today's world, this is a rarity. We wish we could give him more than 5 stars!! 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

Nevertheless, Shane was more than able to handle each one.  He explains how he will tackle each project and let's you know what to expect on both the expense and time involved.  His work is incredible. Both the cabinet installers and the appliance installers were impressed with what he had done.  He always leaves the work area as clean or cleaner than when he started.  He would also try to leave me with as much access to whatever appliances he could during the process.  It can be very difficult these days to find someone who takes pride in their work, is dependable and trustworthy.  Shane Walker is all of that.  We recommend him for any projects you need done."

I am beyond impressed and so very thankful!"

Pool: Mr. Harris assisted me every step of the new pool liner process (correct measurements, ordering and numerous install questions) he was always willing to answer any question.

Everything was going smoothly until the green flow light turned red (Pentair Intellichlor IC40).  Called Jenny, she asked me to send her a picture of the defective part and...YES, they had the part I needed at an amazing price!  Daniel always makes sure I get to the correct area for what I need.  These people are the reason I moved to the south!  Southern hospitality, amazing customer service and if they don't have the part I need, they are always willing to try and order it.  Oh, about a month ago I needed some underwater epoxy putty, they had just ran out, Mr. Harris's son grabbed one off his work truck and gave it to me..What more is there to say.  Awesome business!!!"

I sent Jared a picture of my old water heater and from his experience he was able to tell me that my water heater had been leaking for quite a while and suggested that it was time to get a new one if I was ready. We set up an appointment and he brought a new electric water heater (better quality and more efficient then lows and Hm dept) and installed it. He made the proper fitting adjustments to my old pipes. He also helped me locate my water meter so that he could turn off the water it was covered in 2 inches of dirt and he dug it out. He is very professional and polite (ma'am).

They went and got the new one, unpacked it outside, installed it and took away my old one!! Wonderful job, great people and they are locals!!!"

He explained everything to me in ‘non plumbing’ terms and told me all of my options. It’s hard to find that! He was very honest when he quoted me estimates.

Thank you, Wallace, for your military service and for getting us cooled down so quickly.\n\nA couple of years later and Wallace to the rescue once again. Our heat pump went out, I called Wallace.

You might have to wait if your situation is not urgent, and might need to call back to remind him.  But, he is the one I call first when I have a plumbing problem."

They will do the right thing and tell you the truth and even show it to you and tell you why. They also do maintenance which I like because it keeps your units running, and if they find something that needs to be fixed while they are checking it out they'll bring it to your attention, fix it on the spot and not charge you a service call. Still going to cost you money but at least you know more about what's going on with your units and have peace of mind. It's the doctor visit for your air conditioner. Call Tim he's the owner, if your A/C isn't doing the job I suggest asking him about doing the maintenance on your A/C. He will get you going and clean your system and then you get a tune up every six months and next time you have a problem it probably will get caught in the tune up and not cost a arm and a leg for them to fix it.

Him and his Daddy came the next morning and worked until they finally were able to unclog my pipes. They were very reasonable with their pricing and a pleasure to work with.

I needed a gas line installed for a natural gas grill and they did so with a very fair price. Later on, when implementing a new rear lawn with irrigation, I hired them to install a backflow for the irrigation. After that I had a leak in the master bath shower where they unearthed a messy plumbing job from the flip. It cost me a fortune to get this fixed (I don't mean over priced, instead them cleaning up someone else's botched work), but Bryan and his dad did a great job and I know there won't be a repeat issue in this area. Later on (yet again) I found a spigot on the front of the house wasn't working and they repaired for a very good price. Then late last night after returning home from Christmas festivities, I discovered a pipe had burst from the cold, so I texted Bryan hoping he may have time to assess the problem. Not only did he exchange texts with me around midnight Christmas night, but had 2 guys out here by 11am and they were able to cap off the leak to an outside spigot, plus solve a mystery about no gas coming in to a gas fireplace.\nThese guys are AWESOME! It's a father, son and grandsons family business and they are caring, kind, sweet, clean and true to their word. If you have read this far and need a plumber but choose not to call Around The Clock, you would be foolish. I will never call another company, and will definitely refer them to anyone asking for a reference. Thank you so much guys for always coming to my aid & rescue ~ you're the best of the best!!"

Also when I knocked on your door to ask where your meter was, your dog charged out the door and bit me on my leg. Never once did I or have I ever entered a customers house without first being invited. When you initially called us about the problem, you asked for a ballpark price which I gave you after telling you I did not like to give prices over the phone without looking at the job first, and you said the ballpark I gave you was perfectly fine, and the price I charged you was within the ballpark I quoted you over the phone.

Since then I have used him on several jobs we have needed at our home and my families homes.  He is incredibly responsive.  I would highly recommend for the quick fix jobs of a dripping faucet,  toilet changeout, etc. and/or the larger full remodel/new construction  I have used him on Both and my brother and father have also.  I don’t leave many reviews because not many people now days are worthy of a good review.  But I wanted to be sure I left one for Joey and Acme Plumbing."

Not to mention they charged me HUNDREDS less than anyone else around here! They really took pride in their work and made sure it was done right before they left my house.\nI guarantee you, there’s not another septic company around here that will work to fix your problem from sun down to sun up on a Friday night!

After few minutes, they told me that tank was under my driveway and they couldn’t help me. Devin and his crew were servicing my son’s tank and I mention this experience to him. He assured me that he could help me. After investigation, he discovered that my tank was NOT under the drive. He serviced the tank and it is now operating properly. In addition, my son was very pleased with his service. I highly recommend Pickle, first class service!"

When the day came, they were on time, and when they came across unexpected snafus they dealt with it at the same price they had quoted me originally. Also (mostly) cleaned up after themselves, didn't leave a huge mess for me to deal with. I've been recommending them to everyone I know, and will be calling them back for more work that needs to be done."

Over the past several months and especially during COVID shortages he has provided what seems to be an invaluable resource and that is peace of mind.  I can ask him to resolve anything from replacing a garbage disposal to fixing a fireplace (gas pipe) without having to follow-up with him.  He gets the job done, often goes beyond expectation, and is quick to communicate…even when he just got out of the hospital.

The technician was polite, courteous, and took the time to let me walk him through the issue we were having with our bathtub.  He fixed the problem promptly and even gave me a few pointers to help me prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nI've seen a few bad reviews from people based on their \"home warranty\" and their repair not being covered.  Whether you dispatch a plumber, electrician, or AC specialist, they can only cover items that your home warranty company lets them cover, based on your contract (that you picked).  People should read their contracts first before taking their frustrations out on a local business.  Cheaper home warranties cover less items, go figure."

Thanks to my realtor for doing the leg work and calling different plumbing companies, he gave me Delta's number, and because I had used them in the past I felt comfortable scheduling the inspection for my father's home.\n\nCalling and speaking with Ms. Opal to set up the appointment went without a hitch as she was so very courteous and took the time to answer my questions and was very detailed in the information that she needed as well as the work that would be performed. She even sent a follow up email to let me know that she received my signed authorization form that I emailed back to her....I didn't even have to call and ask....WOW.\n\nThe pleasant experience didn't stop there, Mr. Trace called me once he arrived to the property and then called me back to let me know the results of the inspection. Because I was out of town taking care of my mother, Mr. Trace could have told me anything, but yet he was honest to confirm that the tank was in very good condition and didn't need any service.\n\nThank you to both Ms. Opal and Mr. Trace for your awesome customer service, your attention to detail, and keeping the customer top of mind!!

We had a serious plumbing and called Delta and they were here very quickly since it was an emergency and we didn't want out brand new floor and bathroom ruined because of the back up that was caused from 64 year old cast iorn pipes rusting and breaking apart.    They were here 2 days assessing the job, was here early in the day Wednesday and started the job.  Every piece of dirt was put back into place.....lol .......and the made special care of not tearing up a new baby tree that had just been planted recently.  They doubled checked the water to make sure it was running threw the new pipes properly, had me run water threw the washing machine several times so that everything was flowing correctly and not backing up again.  The speediness and care they gave me was top notch.  Everything they had to do or needed to do they told me first and asked if i wanted to do it and yes we did it.  And I couldn't be happier.  In the past we have used several different plumbers but no one has ever taken the time to explain everything to us and give us the option as to what we wanted to do, and give me the respect I deserve being that its our house and our money.  No pressure or pushing us into a decision we needed to think about it and go over with him on.   I totally recommend Delta Plumbing for any and all plumbing problems they would be the one's I'd call and \"will\" call.  Thank you Jacob for your help, your kindness and concern of what could have happened in the very near future had we not had all those pipes replaced.  Thank you Delta"

I will be using them again to clean my unit this week and any time in the near future.\n\nJust wanted to Thank You for coming back out on 10-2-19 to clean my unit as scheduled. You did a wonderful job. I definitely will be using you for any future needs."

It was late,  after 9:00 pm but my air  conditioning was not working. Temperatures were in the  low 90's for the day.  He could have scheduled for next day but came as soon as he could.\nHe was very professional ,courteous and thorough.  He checked everything out and repaired my unit in a timely manner and I had air conditioning again . It was very late when he finished but I didn't care. My air conditioning was up and running I didn't have to wait til  the next day. !!\nI would recommend this company and Mike again to any of my neighbors and friends."

The company that performed the service informed me of a leak in my AC coils ... Since my home was still under the Home Warranty which we had negotiated at closing, I contacted them in order to set up the service that I was told needed addressing. The warranty company had me contact Michael at Mastercraft. Michael was very prompt in his response to my request, came to my home & diagnosed the problem, & then proceeded to fix my AC issues in a professional manner. Come to find out, my AC coils weren't the issue & it was something much less costly !!  Michael ALWAYS answered my calls & worked late into the night to ensure that my AC was working properly prior to leaving. I Highly recommend Michael at Mastercraft HVAC for his prompt & professional service !!"

I spoke with Michael rather late on a Friday (I believe), probably 6 or 7pm, he told me what I could do to try and cool our house because it was 82 degrees and he said that if it hadn't cooled down within an hour he would come out that night and fix it since we have a 1 year old that was running a fever. What he told us cooled the house and kept it cool. Michael came out a few days later, he was late for his appointment but when he arrived he apologized multiple times and explained why he was late, he diagnosed our A/C unit and filled it with refrigerant. He was extremely nice and professional. I waited to write the review to make sure that his work would hold up and it has perfectly! A/C during an Alabama summer is required and Michael made sure we had one that works properly.\nThank you Michael!"

Then they poured a 22' wide driveway with nice deep expansion joints within all of the specified intervals to prevent it from cracking in the wrong places. They raised the sidewalk to make it flush with the porch and driveway. They gave us a 4' wide new layout sidewalk with lots of extras, which one would expect on a new house that is much more expensive. They backfilled everything after removing the forms and scrapped the moss and roots off the front yard and spread 3 inches of rich black top soil across the entire front yard. They also laid crossties bordering the ally. Everything was done at the original estimated price a week ahead of schedule, which was half as much as the most popular cement laying company in Decatur who had delayed us a couple times. Plus they did a lot more than what was originally estimated."

When I asked for additional work, he was clear about costs that were beyond our initial contract. Mark has a good eye for color and design (paint, flooring, blinds etc.) and practical sense to recommend what is economical.\nWhat I most appreciated was fact that Mark discovered a pipe/plumbing problem under our house. Since my home is owned by an entity that needed to approve repair of this pipe, Mark was appropriately assertive and persistent in making this known since my property owner did not believe there was a problem. Mark provided video proof that the pipe problem existed, and Mark's proof convinced the owner to repair it. Mark is assertive in a quiet respectful way that works well.\nI also appreciated Mark's flexibility in adjusting to delays from my end that necessitated Mark to extend his work timeline to finish our project.\nI rate Mark highly in expertise, communication throughout a project, flexibility, persistence, patience, and quality of work. The final product was excellent. I find Mark to be responsible, honest, and trustworthy.\nBob Poirier"

I called on a Sunday, planning to leave a voice message for the next day. Taylor returned my call quickly and said he should be able to see me on Tuesday, which was about the time-line I expected.

The yard looked immaculate when he left. Kudos to Jeff and Absolute Environmental.  They are the “absolute” best."

She told me that they would be able to get somebody out on Saturday November 10th to pump our septic tank. We were experiencing some back a few months ago a plumber took care of that but recently with all the rain we were smelling sewage and we were seeing some leakage around the ground for our septic tank. The guys came out on Saturday and it was getting close to dark and were very professional and they in detail showed me how the septic system works. We've never owned a home before we've always lived in apartments previous to this. We pumped our septic tank about 5 years ago which was about two years after we moved in we're experiencing the same symptoms of smell and leakage. They came out and in detail told me how the septic system works. Because in the last year we've had our downstairs bathroom backup 2-3  times. Unfortunately there's a good chance that are field lines are deteriorated. We've been considering moving our septic tank to a new part of the property and the prices are reasonable. However because we have a stream in our backyard we may have to have a healthcare inspection done which could make us run them into our front yard. They were honest and gave us the Good Bad and The Ugly. These guys are extremely professional. they actually showed me where our tank lid was cracked from our previous pumping from a different company, who will remain namless, however the cracked lid they did what they could to secure it so the rain water won't be able to sleep into it. They also showed me where a new headline was installed at some point. They also told me that the previous owners, who were elderly when we bought the property. May have let the maintenance of the septic system go. same symptoms of smell and luggage. They came out and detail told me how the septic system work because the last year we've had our downstairs bathroom back up to three times. I would HIGHLY recommend this company. We have some major decisions to make about our septic tank, however we were not pressured at all to make a decision."

Our septic tank is located in a very inaccessible area, but they got back there.  I knew that the price was going to be much higher than they said on the phone because of the conditions.  A big rock had slid down and broken the top.  When they got it loose and tried to pump it out, dirt kept sliding down into the tank.  In the end after 6 hours of constant work, until nearly midnight, they got it open and usable on a temporary basis.  The concrete tank was cracked, so I had to have a new installation.  They are in the middle of it now.  Got the new tank in and hooked up.  Now they have to do the leach field tomorrow.  I am very pleased with the very difficult work they have done.  The tank is literally on the side of the hill, very difficult to get to and work around. This is the first time I have had work done without getting estimates, but, when you have sewage in the basement you don't have time to shop around.  From what I have seen online, their price is very competitive with others, even with the difficulty of the terrain. I will post additional after it is done, but I am very pleased and would gladly recommend them."

Jonathan is a pro using the mini-excavator and left my property looking manicured. Jason is dynamic all-around.  I am pleased with the work. Jennifer, the secretary, was also an excellent communicator and efficient with returning phone calls."

Thanks Aboslute for helping us today. We look forward working with you all."

Bo came out and inspected the septic system, immediately identifying that the field lines needed to be replaced and that previous work was not only done incorrectly, but illegally and out of code. (an access point had been installed incorrectly so the tank couldn't even be pumped!!).\n\nThe home owners called the \"other guys\" (a BIG time septic company in town) out there who vouched on their (incorrect) work. Furthermore, they said a cheap $500 connector would fix the problem - a lot less than the $3,500 job that was suggested. Bo didn't bat an eye, he encouraged me to call not JUST the local health inspector but the Director of the Waste Water Management Board of Alabama (the governing body for ALL these companies). Amazingly, I got her on the phone (she was very nice!). She verbally confirmed that Bo was correct. She also vouched the consistency and integrity of Absolute as a company.\n\nOkay ... well that's not on site, so we get the county health inspector out there. HE confirms EVERYTHING that Bo said. The health inspector completely inspected the system. The work was out of code/illegal. Done poorly. Not completed. Field lines HAD to be replaced. EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT. This guy is the real deal. They are fantastic to work with, flexible, understanding, quick to respond via email or phone. Bo came on site 2 separate times with short notice to give his recommendations and they credited all charges to the final project.\n\nThis is an industry where people get taken advantage of ALL the time, but Bo and Absolute REFUSE to operate outside the bounds and do the work right! USE THEM. Any company that encourages you to check their work .... that's a good sign."

They were able to solve the issues quickly and offer solutions for a reasonable cost compared to other septic companies in the area. I spoke with a dozen different septic companies and all of their prices varied and Absolute was by far the most affordable AND they're the MOST professional! They solve the problem quickly and really know what they're doing. I can't say enough good things about them and would recommend them to everyone I know. We were ripped off by another septic company (we are reporting them and possibly suing) in the area and Absolute saved the day (our house was probably a day or two away from flooding from the septic tank)!"

His knowledge of septic systems and the history of them throughout our community gave us the assurance that we had picked the right company.\n\nAfter all of the testing and acquiring of permits Bo and his team began work and had the plumbing in and working within 3 days. I could not believe it. After weeks of waiting we were ‘reconnected to the world’ and we could not be happier. His team was very professional, cordial and respectful of the impact that this project was having on our family.\n\nI hope I never have to deal with this problem again in life, but If I do, and AEP is anywhere in the area, they are who I will call."

Because of problems with sellers and inspector dragging feet it was not possible.   Bo agreed to still get it done after signing as long as it was payed upfront by sellers.  After talking to Bo personally I realized that he was a man made of integrity.    Because of weather and other issues getting it done as quick as originally agreed on was not possible. It was starting to worry me if it would be done at all.   Bo however did come out personally as promised and went above and beyond to take care of our problem.  So as far as being skeptical about him and his company because of other reviews, don’t. He is a man of his word that takes pride in his work.  He won’t break rules or cut corners. He believes in exceptional work and expects nothing less than that from his employees.   I saw where people said he was rude and had a temper.  I disagree.  All he ask is you show him respect for what he does and he will show you the same.   He is a very nice person as long as you take a second and realize you chose him for his expertise not the other way around(or you would be doing the job yourself).  I knew nothing about septic systems before today as this was my first house with it and Bo and his staff took plenty of time to explain in great, yet simple and easy terminology, about how it works and what to expect.  So with this.  Thank you Bo for the exceptional work and wonderful knowledge.   I look forward to using you for all my septic needs and highly recommend absolute environmental services to anyone needing this time of work done."

It was Greek to me but I am glad it was done that way. This was very important because you never know who will need to know what in the future. The repairs were done quickly and expertly. Before they left the leaks were checked to ensure no more water issues. I really appreciate all the effort to complete my repairs."

We used a different company to pump once and they didn’t even reinstall caps properly.\n\nOne call to Miss Sandy and not only did her team respond to pump immediately … she personally showed up to discuss our concerns. Then, she took it upon herself to find our original septic approval plans, theorize potential causes for our issues, and give us advice/a way forward. She isn’t coming in to make radical, costly repair suggestions, she is truly coming in to get to the root of the issue through the best means possible.\n\nLong and short, she isn’t in the business to make a quick buck on her costumer … it’s the exact opposite. She truly values and cares about each person she’s called to aid and will exhaust every viable effort with the least amount of cost and disruption.

They answered all my questions and helped educate me on what should be done when a septic tank is pumped.  Come to find out, the previous company did about 50% of what should've been done.

We’re new in the area and didn’t know who to call so we reached out again to the Muddy Buddy crew. At first, Glenda patiently walked me through via phone in finding a solution, but when that didn’t work, Guy dropped his morning plans to help solve our lawn irrigation problem (even though this was not a standard plumbing service). These awesome folks didn’t have to respond on a Sunday morning, but they did and I’m just continually amazed by the people we’ve interacted with here in Huntsville AL, most especially Guy and Glenda for their above and beyond sincerity, and customer care. I know this might be saying much, but these are truly good folks and I have no hesitation referring family and friends to them.

The pipe was busted under the concrete so Muddy Buddy had to reroute the pipe to another location. A different company came out before and obviously damaged the pipe while trying to get it to drain, and then they did an estimate to reroute the pipes just in case it needed it. Obviously, it needed it after the pipe wall was busted at the first turn. Their price climbed to over $2k in less than 10 minutes by adding in other pipes and parts that had to be replaced (but didnt need to be replaced). Muddy Buddy did the job that needed to be done without replacing good pipes in a few hours that the other company said would take a week, and Muddy Buddy did the job for 1/3 of the price of the other company's estimate and didnt add in other pipes, parts, and days of labor just to make a buck. Good old fashioned service without trying to rip off their customers."

They did so good I had them check some other plumbing things and found out work previously was done improperly and explained exactly what and why it was this way. I called the other company and asked them why and when I explained it to them they didn’t have an answer and wanted to come back out to my house and redo the work properly. I said \"NO\" and called Muddy Buddy back and gave them the work which in turn they fixed everything wrong immediately and at an affordable price. Highly recommend this Company.

This is a local family business that prides themself on being proficient, friendly and punctual. They have pumped my tank more than 3 times and replaced the lines coming from the tank. They guided me through the process and made sure to explain everything so that I completely understood what was going on. After installing new lines they spread grass seed and fertilizer so that my yard could get back to normal. The bottom line is this... I can't imagine getting better service from anyone else. They come highly recommended for a reason. Thanks Tina and everyone on the All-Pro Team!"

We recently bought a home and were told the tank had been pumped a year ago but the previous owners could not provide any info on when it was down or who did it. We didn’t have issues with our system but wanted to have it inspected/pumped just to make sure it was cared for. This team was able to get out to pump it 3 days after our call (it was not an emergency so I was more than happy to wait) they showed up early in the day and got the whole job completed within an hour. They showed me the tank after it was uncovered and were told it looks like it has NEVER been pumped! They were all professional and friendly, gave me advice on how to care for the tank life long as I have never had a septic tank before. They explained in great detail what to watch for and how often to have it pumped, they never tried to upsell me even though it would have been easy as I have no idea about anything septic lol they stood firm on their quote they gave me via email and were even reluctant to take a tip because they didn’t feel it was necessary. If you want an honest and friendly company that doesn’t try to milk you for money this is the one to go with! Even though they were very busy they didn’t seem inconvenienced by all of my questions 10/10 recommend"

From Tina (who I’ve learned is the Mom) to her son, Gage who was the guy who came to service our septic system, they were amazing. We moved into a new house a week ago and our septic stopped draining. Gage came out and pumped us and inspected the system. He confirmed it’s not draining. Gave me number to call to have new field lines drawn up then call all pro back to do the service. I have 4 sons and my toddler asks a lot of questions. Gage answered everything. He was very professional and kind. What would usually be a super stressful experience, this company is making me feel confident that it will be fine and they will handle it. Also the pricing!!!! I called 5 different septic companies to get my septic pumped and service and every quote was over 500$ to pump. Some even said it would be another 100$ to dig to be able to pump. My husband is military and dug it before he left the country. All pro came out and after military discount I was only charged 275$ for pumping and inspecting it. If you have septic issues just do yourself a favor and hire All Pro. Photo is my husband thinking he could fix the problem himself 🤣"

Well I couldn't fix it, they said they would come out Sunday...I was like ok I can wait...they called me back the next day and said they could come earlier than scheduled...I said great. They came out and examined system, fixed the problem in less than 20 minutes while giving me a SEPTIC 101 class at the same time. I really appreciate the knowledge, professionalism and education provided. Call this company, they will get it done!!!!"

Which was a problem for some. But not for Jamie, he quickly uncovered the lid with his mini Digger. And got to work with quality equipment. He paid attention to every detail of my tank and saw I had a a slight problem a plastic baffle piece and fixed it and also applied a new filter too.\nThe clean up of the yard was also great too. He made sure all dirt was back to ground level smooth.\nI would highly recommend this company again and he and my family will continue you use him until he quits the business.\nThis company is not out just to suck your tank out and leave. They truly want to do what’s right and make sure you are taken care of."

The guy scheduled me for that day because he wasn't busy and he came right out to the house. Super nice guy. He looked at our tank and explained to me what size I had and how many and gave me a quote before he started any work. Great communicator! He and his brother did a quality service. You can pay cash, check or card. He had a glitch with his new square reader but I helped him figure it out and then he got excited and we started laughing about it.

He has worked for me on many projects since 2013, but this time, he helped me get my house ready to put on the market. There was so much to do and I was overwhelmed. Israel took my list of needs and did everything quickly and beautifully. He bought and installed new granite, rebuilt a crumbling deck, replaced boards on the gables of my house and garage doors, fixed my staircase, pressure washed the house and so much painting. He did much more than I can list.\n\nIsrael has trained his team to work efficiently and effectively—no one stands around and waists time. They get in and get the job done and leave everything clean and beautiful. I am planning to downsize and when I find the right house, he will do any remodeling I need done. He always saves me time and money. You will never find a better, more professional person to work for you. Tell Israel what you want and he can build it, repair it or install it—anything you need. I highly recommend this company—\nOne thousand duties LLC."

He has installed a closet light, chandelier, new laundry room sink, caulked a bathroom, fixed a closet door, hung a heavy mirror, rewired a TV so you can’t see the wires, demoed a basement taking out old cabinetry and repainting. He is very knowledgeable and able to answer questions so he gets your job done perfectly! He is honest, pricing is fair and he leaves your home better than before.

I recommend their business to anyone I come into contact with who wants to know where to find any kind of hardware. Home town people with a home town business is what Highland Home Hardware is and that should be all that's needed to be told here!

Turned out to be something that would have to be dealt with by the city, but apparently one of these guys felt bad about not being able to address the underlying issue, so he decided to clean up and repair some of the damage that had been caused by it.  Took about an hour and he didn't charge a dime.\n\nCut to the chase, I am so glad I made this call because Jeremy was very timely in his response and in getting the job done. Very knowledgeable and professional with competitive pricing. Definitely our  go-to now for any future plumbing needs. Very highly recommend. 10 stars"

I had had enough.   He was at my home around 6 that same day.  I did not expect that.  He had to redo the plumbing for the dishwasher as it was all wrong and had to take out the wood floor there to get the new one to fit.  The newer dishwashers are way different then the old ones.   It was so a relief having this young man come to our aide.   I will call him for future plumbing issues and will recommend him to others as well.

Not only was he on time, he was actually a bit early. He immediately got to work. He thought initially the septic tank might need pumped, however, on further inspection,  the pipe in the basement had come loose from what was holding it up properly and was now sitting at a downward angle. It wasn't allowing everything to pass through and thus there was a huge clog. Jeremy soon had everything cleaned out, that section of pipe replaced and resealed, and mounted back to the wall properly. He was extremely professional, courteous and I will most definitely call him again should I need anything in the future.\nThank you Jeremy!"

He was informative and helpful while repairing our kitchen faucet... he explained the problem thoroughly and told us how to repair should it happen again.\n\nWhile doing the repair he noticed that my dishwasher was unlevel and a little wompy...so he fixed that too. He ended up having to cut into the cabinets to get everything to fit proper and brought up his shop vac to clean up. Cleaned under all my major appliances while he was at it. I later made a comment to watch his step on a flight of stairs because my light was out and he offered to fix that too.\n\nJeremy is the most diligent repair man I've met. He cuts no corners and really goes above and beyond. Highly recommend."

I think that most plumbers would have worked on each of the problems until they were somewhat better.  Jeremy immediately realized that all three problems could be traced to the same cause: a bad water pressure regulator.  He checked the regulator, found that it had indeed failed, and replaced it.  That solved all three problems completely.  He is a terrific person to work with."

I chose Monday, as I was coming from out of town. He told me he would be late afternoon  and then updated me when his guy was running  a little late. When Jason, his assistant arrived he jumped right on it and all about business. I will definitely use them for all my plumbing in Montgomery AL."

He came at precisely the time we had scheduled. he performed the exact services we had contracted for and at a price that I thought was very competitive. In todays society it is almost impossible to find anyone that even wants to works. His professionalism & expertise is only exceeded by his great attitude & politeness. I highly recommend Ronnie Crimes services."

We are not originally from here so we looked around online and went with them for the five star reviews we saw.  My wife called them the next morning they quoted a very reasonable price and came out earlier than expected.  Turned out we were about one flush away from it backing up into the house.  I didn't get the chance to meet them because I was at work but from what I was told, I wish I did.  They had to do a bit more work than just a standard pumping but still were willing to stick to the original quoted price.  She told me they were so friendly and professional and efficient that she agreed to pay them the higher amount anyway.  Alot of people could have chosen to rake her over the coals telling her they had to dig up the whole drain field or some major catastrophe.  She just had a heart attack and no one deserves that anyway.  I didn't meet them but I can't express in words how thankful I am for this company and the service they provided.  With honesty, courtesy and professionalism.  I would recommend them to anyone and everyone who needs any septic services.  Couldn't be happier.  I wouldn't even think of calling anyone else.  You guys have our business for as long as we have this tank.  Thank you and God Bless!"

Jeremy is an absolute professional when it comes to communication, being thorough about your project, and just being overall pleasant to deal with. Those are definitely rare qualities that you find in the contractor space that customers absolutely value on top of the fantastic quality of workmanship.

Jeremy tiled our bathroom floor, our shower floor and walls, and our whirlpool tub surround including adding a decorative glass inlay we wanted, plus special grout. He and his team were always on time, professional, responsive, and worked to make sure we were 100% satisfied with the job and how it turned out, even coming back after the glass company installed the shower doors to make it just right where the glass met the polished tile.

But when I had to call him a second time to come unclog the toilet, I knew that it was just time to replace it. I talked to him about installing a new toilet, got a quote, and expected to have to wait at least a week or more before he would be able to get back out to put in the new toilet, but nope!

This didn't make him a dime!  That is why I'm writing this review... if Josh hadn't helped me when no one else would I would still be trying to find parts on internet!

I could tell immediately upon meeting him that he was experienced, highly motivated, intentional and thoughtful about wanting to help us get to the root of our issue. All things I would hope for from a service professional. But what\nhe didn’t realize was that we had been working with other companies who didn’t respond in the same, professional and prompt and thorough way, and with the stress of my dad’s health decline simultaneously happening with his home’s A/C issues, we were desperate for a prompt, but also kind, thoughtful and helpful professional to swoop in and get our issues resolved quickly! And that’s what we got from Dustin and we’re just so grateful! A/C Pros not only helped us fix the issues quickly, but they did it with care. Don’t hesitate to call them!"

It was refreshing that I did not have to call them.\n\nWe woke up this morning to discover our heat wasn’t working and, of course, it is supposed to be freezing cold in just a few days. I called Justin about 7:45AM and he was here a little after 9:00. Turned out to be an electrical problem so Justin called an electrician he works with and that fellow came by this afternoon and fixed the problem. So problem solved same day as discovered. It’s refreshing to work with folks who care about providing quality service."

The two rooms that would not cool down are now cooler and I don’t have to listen to teen and pre-teens complain how hot they are anymore 😜 Dustin and his group were super friendly, professional and very timely.

I had my normal AC Maintenance company who installed the last system come check things out. They replaced a faulty capacitor and departed. Within a few days things went bad again. I tried to contact my old company again and couldnt reach anyone or get a call back. So I began my search for a new AC company.\n\nA/C Pro's had top ratings and recommendations on Google and Nextdoor for my area. I gave them a call and Dustyn came over the same day to inspect the system. It was determined that a stepper motor switch had gone belly up. Dustyn ordered my parts from the TRANE dealer that same day and returned on Monday to install them.\n\nUnfortunately that didnt solve the problems for long. The EEV Board, a typical failed part around the 10 year mark in TRANE TAM7 units was the real problem and been causing the system to have issues. Dustyn researched ordering the part only to find TRANE no longer manufactured the part. They were having to make them. With a 2 month delay until we could get it and summer heat building we had discussions with Dustyn on replacement systems rather than continuing to piece meal life support into our aging unit.\n\nAC Pro's prepared a quote for a few options that would meet our needs and were very affordable. We never felt pressured to buy a new system or to purchase a more expensive system than necessary to meet our needs. Once we signed an agreement on a replacement system Dustyn picked up our equipment the same day we placed the order. Rain delayed the install a few days but the first available day of sunshine the install team returned and Dustyn and Shane knocked out the removal and installation of a new RHEEM HeatPump AC system to our home. They were able to install the system without any modifications to the old systems current location.\n\nThey completed the job promptly in just under 4 hours time. They made sure to clean up all the remains from the old system. Dustyn registered the system for us with RHEEM for the warranty and they did a full field test of the new system.\n\nWe were very pleased with the ease of the installation, the sales process and no up-selling or hidden costs. No pressure to purchase more system than needed. We have an upstairs system that is the same age as the one we replaced and fully plan to use AC Pro's to replace it as well. We also are planning to add a Mini-Split to a mother-in-law suite.\n\nA/C Pro's is a great company with courteous and knowledgeable technicians. Very responsive to customer needs and treated us like we were family from the first visit. If you need a new AC or just routine maintenance this is your team to call."

Yesterday, I had performed a Factory Reset of my Thermostat yesterday but didn’t know the correct answers for the codes that were then presented after the Reset. I woke up this morning and the house was cold, I turned the heat on and the house became colder. I called the A/C Pros at lunch and the owner immediately picked up the phone and generously offered to talk me through the settings for free over the phone when I got home tonight! He then sent me a text later to again confirm that he was glad to help when I got home. As promised, he immediately picked up the phone when I got home after 6 pm, he pulled out the Manual specific to my Thermostat, and talked me through about 2 dozen codes and my system is now working perfectly!\nI will never forget that generosity as he refused to accept payment and merely said, “Glad to help”. This business is a wonderful of all the great, honorable, and selfless generosity that makes America the best country in the World! A/C Pros will always have my deepest respect and gratitude"

Dustin contacted me and offered his assistance.  Now normally I would never allow a repair person in my home by strictly a Facebook message but he presented himself as very professional and assured me this was a legit business.  I’m happy to say I took a chance and am more than pleased.  He was fairly priced, kind, prompt ( and even took his shoes off before entering my home-y’all, that’s a big deal)  and assisted me in ordering the needed parts to get the fireplace going again.  Just in time for the holidays. Thank you so much!"

I tried another company that told me the stains on my pool liner was \"unlike anything he's ever seen,\" and I \"should consider replacing my liner.\" Mr. Moore assured me that the stain was only algae and he could get it removed and pool ready for swimming asap. They did exactly that. Every homeowner needs a trustworthy handyman this is why I HIGHLY recommend Moorer's handyman services."

When I brought them up to Gary he had them fixed in a timely manner and at no extra cost. I never felt that his bottom line came before our requests for our home. I saw many contractors before deciding on Carlisle construction. Many of them just never responded. Those who did were either very high-priced, did not have proper licensing or could not return phone calls in a timely manner. I can honestly say I had none of those issues with Gary. He always got back to me promptly and had all of the licenses and paperwork. I have no regrets having hired Carlisle construction."

Gary is thorough, punctual and professional in his business approach and customer service, which resulted in his team completing the fencing of my backyard in two (2) days! I provided my vision. Gary captured that vision and made it come to fruition before without delay. In business, one’s word is everything. Carlisle Contracting stands by their word, and should be the standard by which all other contractors are measured. I will be a returning customer. That’s my word."

          "review_text": "We found Gary and Carlisle Contracting with a Google search and an answered prayer. Half way through building our forever home, we had to part ways with the builder. Our home was built to the point where sheetrock was hung and taped. From there we were on our own to finish: paint, flooring, tile, cabinets, countertops, all electrical and plumbing fixtures/trim out, interior doors and trim, shake, soffit, gutters, concrete, septic tank, landscaping, water heater installation, HVAC and gas final, and appliance installation.\nWe were blessed to locate the original subs for electrical, plumbing, and gas and they returned to complete their work.\nEnter Gary. Gary and his team worked with us to complete over 4500sq ft of paint, hardwood flooring, tile (floors and shower), interior doors and trim, shake, soffit, gutters, concrete and septic tank installation. A sentence does not quite depict the magnitude of the job Gary and his team took on. We quoted the work in Sep 2022 with a hard completion deadline in Feb 2023 for all work - Gary’s Team and all of the original subcontractors.\nIn addition to scheduling his team, Gary also coordinated with the original subs for scheduling to keep things on track to meet our deadline.\nGary and his team were Professional, On Time, and On Budget throughout our project.\nThey not only took pride in their work, they cared about us and the vision we had for our home. They used their knowledge and experience to make recommendations of alternatives and were graciously willing to go through trial and error with us when we had to change course on design or material for accent walls, fireplace wall design, and ensuring we had the perfect stain color for our front door and cedar posts.\nGary was with us for every step through final inspection for occupancy.\nSimply put, Gary was a Godsend. Finishing a house build without a builder could have been unbelievably stressful. Finding a builder or contractor to come after another builder with a fixed budget and deadline could have been unbelievably stressful.\nBut God. He sent us Gary. We are forever Grateful and forever Thankful for Gary and Carlisle Contracting."

Gary at Carlisle Contracting was driving through my neighborhood when I stopped him to ask a quote for cleaning the siding on my house.

When I tell you what I thought would be hours only took 15 minutes, I’m not even slightly exaggerating. This stuff was awesome! So not only did Gary save me time, but he saved me money by not letting me get bamboozled. This to me is a huge gain in trust when they care more about you than they do your business and your money. #ContractorAcquired"

I have been doing a little remodeling and had committed to a big box chain and a local company and have not had a great experience with their contractors. I asked Jake to come in and do some services that those companies did not offer, and I would like to say that working with Jake has been a worry/stree-free experience for me. Jake arrived when he said he would. His work quality was outstanding, and he communicated any issues or concerns as they came up. I wish I would have known about Jake's Home Solutions before I committed to the other companies, because if I had to do it over again, I would have allowed Jake to do it all.

He designed a new vent system so that no pipes would show up through the roof sections at the front of the house. He also created a new water supply system throughout the house using PEX. He even replaced some pvc on our pool pump! Sims gave a lot of great advice along the way and helped us overcome several obstacles in our remodeling. We will be having him return shortly to hook up all of the fixtures as soon as the drywall is complete. Sims is very personable and passionate about doing quality work.

Blake has always been very sweet and patient explaining everything to me. He not only found a rare part for my shower due to old pipes but made sure to give me the part info should I ever need another, but his company also came out to my house two days after Christmas to fix a busted pipe as planned but they also fixed my sink as well that they were not told about during the call and showed no irritation with this. So many other times they have come out due to old pipes that they have always gone above and beyond for my family. Highly recommend Hobbs Plumbing for any and all plumbing needs, They are amazing!"

John and his team are easy to work with and we have been really pleased with the results.\n\nJohn is both personable and extremely knowledgeable. He has been very helpful in suggesting changes to the approach on the repairs (I feel he saved us quite a bit) and also things we weren't aware of that should be addressed before larger repairs are necessary. John was very thorough and detail oriented with the work performed, and again, we were happy with the quality and results.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend John and his team."

The board he originally brought did not match exactly so he worked with a fellow contractor to find the exact piece (at no extra charge to us) and made the repair/replacement in a timely manner. He and his assistant did a fantastic job and you cannot even tell where the old boards end and the new boards start, perfect color matching and craftsmanship. They were on time, courteous, and efficient. We cannot wait to hire John and his team for more projects around our home!"

We initially were going to have our ceiling damage repaired by a guy our friends recommended, but the quote he gave was way over the top and included items we didn’t want fixed. They also did not have the ability to match our plaster design, requiring removal of the entire drywall.\n\nJohn came out within 48 hours of us reaching out was able to give us detailed step by step instructions on what we needed to do to cut down on cost of repairs, and his plasterer Anthony was able to perform a ceiling patch and plaster match, which reduced the overall cost of the project by a significant amount. Anthony was extremely skilled and matched our ceiling pattern perfectly within 2 hours (he patched about a 8x16 foot hole and plastered it). John and his assistant were back out to seal the water stains and paint our ceilings as soon as the plaster dried—they were quick and were able to not drip any ceiling paint on any of our brand new floors, which we certainly would not have been able to do ourselves!\n\nOverall, great customer service, quick repairs,  and great cost! I’ve attached pictures to this post because I’m still amazed that they were able to perfectly match our crazy from the 60’s plaster pattern."

Thankfully, Paul and his team are passionate about the services they provide. I have not only received high quality work with top tier customer service but LT Drain and Small Repair also deliver the best for a fair price. I’m quite sure everyone has experienced a business that will take advantage of the customer and attempt to hustle said customer into unnecessary costs. Paul has done 2 jobs for me so far and the 3rd job I requested was an unnecessary one. Instead of taking advantage of me, he let me know what caused the issue and he assured me the 2nd job would take care of said issue. He knows his industry and it turns out that his advice was spot on! Not only has he earned my business but he has also earned my trust! I won’t do business with anyone else in the industry and I am so thankful to have found them!!!"

They also just felt like the most honest of the choices & we felt most comfortable choosing to hire them for the job. Then, when it came time to do the work, they were fast/efficient, friendly, and the repairs (new fittings & access panel) looked fantastic. And when an unexpected problem popped up, causing them to need to work a bit longer, they went above & beyond without adding any extra charges. Definitely plan on using them for any & all future plumbing needs. Hoping this review saves others the time & effort of shopping around. You can’t go wrong with these guys. 👍👍"

He, was so professional that I was comfortable with him. He, not only did the work he was being paid to do. He went beyond that and tightened a faucet that he noticed was in need of attention.\nI am so appreciative that God sent the right person. I  highly recommend CJ Plumbing and Gas."

He gave me a price that almost knocked me over BECAUSE it was MORE THAN FAIR. (WAY less than the “national average “ to do that kind of job) not only that AFTER he quoted me the price and did the rather large job he fixed a couple of minor problems for me .....he said “it won’t take but a few extra  minutes and it’s no problem ” (he had already been here for a few hours!)  I will be using him for any plumbing needs I have in the future and I highly recommend him. He is knowledgeable, helpful, reasonable, fair, kind, and the quality of his work is excellent."

He openly admitted there *might\" be a 2nd issue, but there would be a different need than he could provide (e.g tile work), so he prepared me for that possible next step. Good news - as of 1 month later I have ZERO evidence of any water and Carter's plumbing work saved the day - and I haven't forked over any $$$ for extra tile/construction work!!!\nFrom a value perspective, I don't have any comparable dollars. That said, he was very transparent how he charged and provided a clear bill. I did not at all feel like he took advantage of the job based upon the work he performed and time he spent. He was quite thorough, and seemingly very honest and transparent in his diagnosis and solution, and quite knowledgeable of his trade!!!\nOn top of his work, he was friendly and courteous. He was dog-friendly and was very affectionate to our sweet Peggy. ♥️\nThank you, Carter, for great work!"

Jarrett arrived the next day exactly at the appointed time.  He had everything he needed to compete the task with him.  He explained to me why the original configuration of discharge piping (dishwasher as well as the garbage disposal) were not optimal and changed them to both look and function better.  He also installed a new garbage disposal.  All of this was completed in less than 1.5 hours and at an expense that was much less than I had anticipated (I've lived at this location over thirty years and had other plumbing issues).  Needless to say, I'm very impressed with Anything Plumbing and they are in my contacts folder.  Jarrett will be coming back in the near future to replace an old Shower valve for me."

He only repaired what he needed to and the cost was contained.  I know that if he wanted to be shady he could have been.  The opportunity was there, but I really am thankful that honest guys like Jaritt are out there.\n\nOn the technical side of details, my outdoor hose bib was leaking and has been since the house was purchased last year.  The home inspector identified high water psi, and also the leaking hose bib.  The inspectors said you should probably request a pressure regulator on your house, it is very high.  I decided not to request a pressure regulator but I did request the hose bib be fixed.  Long story short is, it was not fixed.\n\nAs it got closer to winter I started worrying about water freezing around the wet ground where it leaks and then messing up my foundation so I called Jaritt.\n\nAt the end of the service Jaritt tells me that he did not need to install a psi regulator because the psi was normal now and then explained that the city had fixed the issue in my neighborhood.  So there was opportunity there to jack the price.  But he was honest and I am appreciative.  Definitely recommend."

While he was checking on the trim job I asked him if he knew someone for a cabinet job not knowing he also did that as well. From start to finish Slade was a man of his word unlike multiple other Montgomery contractors who I have been burned by. He made it clear to expect some touch up needed and until I was satisfied he sent his crew everyday until it was up to my standards. He also tried to save me money with different ways of doing things which is unheard of which I truly appreciated. I will be using him for all my jobs going forward and he is a gem for this area.

I needed to have the fascia board on the back of my house replaced and an exterior door frame fixed from water damage. They replaced the fascia board with MiraTech which has a much longer life than wood.  Work was completed within a few hours and it looks great!

They got no paint on the brick of the house and it looks brand new. They  even painted the garage door. The owner stated they were starting a power wash business as well and quoted me a price for my driveway and stone walkway. They pressure washed my driveway and walkway and it looks just like the concrete's been poured. What a face lift. They started at 8:00 a.m. and finished by 4:30. I highly recommend them"

We had thought we might have to purchase a new door.\nSlade assessed the damage and knew immediately what had to be done and  advised that he could repair the door using a sanding and painting technique.  He took pictures and later returned with a paint chart so we could select a color.\nThis was a 3-day process.  He was always on time and called prior to his arrival as we had requested. He was very professional and explained exactly what he was doing at each step of the process.  He was meticulous and took the necessary time to ensure the work was done properly.  Slade stands by his work.\nThe completed product was outstanding. We intend to ask him to return in the future regarding other projects."

I contacted 3 contractors for bids. 2 of the contractors wanted to replace the facia boards ( which did not need to be done). This put the other contractors bids over $2000. Slade came in and was honest and repaired on what was needed. Which in the end saved me a lot of money. Very professional and excellent work. Could not have found a better group of guys. I will call them again for sure. Thank you Slade and family for a job well done."

They installed new plumbing in the kitchen and bathrooms. The kitchen sink was replaced with a stainless steel 60/40 and installed a new garbage disposal.

He took off his shoes before entering my home and he let me know that he had never found a tooth crown in anyone’s kitchen sink. He loosened the cv elbow pipe and poured its contents out in a plastic container and there was my crown. I was so excited because his cost was a lot cheaper than a new crown. He provided me with his business card and I will definitely use his services again and let everyone know how professional he was. He even pet my dog that was anxious and she calmed down barking. The price for his service was very reasonable and he was a kind young man."

          "review_text": "We recently worked with Jake at J. Henry Construction and could not have been happier.  We contracted him to replace the 60+ year old kitchen and kicked around the idea for quite some time.  Price and quality were a big consideration because the amount of what we wanted to do was extensive.  We wanted to remove a load bearing wall and open up the kitchen to the rest of the house, move a closet, add a pocket door, replace electric and two windows, and install new cabinetry and flooring.\nBecause this was such a large project, we had quotes done from multiple contractors.  Having just done a living room project the year before it was important to me that the contractor did the majority of the work themselves. This was because the last project sat unworked and empty while we waited for subcontractors to come in and complete their sections.  Since a family of 5 relies so heavily on a kitchen I was looking for a contractor that could control the schedule and do it quickly.  Jake reassured me that all the work would be done by himself and would be complete in 4-5 weeks.  His price was considerably lower than our other quotes and he presented me with an itemized quote that addressed all the items I wanted included.  He started on time and finished on time as promised without issue.\nWe worked out all the details and stayed with relatives while Jake started because of the impact the demo would have to our home.  While we were out, he taped off a plastic screen that isolated the kitchen from the rest of the house.  Within three days everything was ripped out down to the 2x4’s and the load bearing wall was removed and the unilam support beam installed.  Our neighbor sent us pictures and I couldn’t believe how much work had been done.  You could see all the way up into the attic from our kitchen!\nIn the two weeks we were away, all the demo, structural work, electric was replaced, new insulation replaced, permit inspection completed and drywall went up.  Its important to note the level of communication Jake maintained during all this was high.  Our drawings showed six can lights and two pendant lights that looked fine on paper, but the 6th can light would have been too close to one of the pendants to look right.  When Jake realized this, he called me promptly, explained it to me and recommended we remove it from the plan.  I think a lot of contractors would have just installed everything per the drawing but Jake took the time to make sure it was going to look right and we were completely happy. It’s clear the Jake truly cares about the quality and appearance of his work.\nThere were so many little things that Jake and his partner did that impressed me along the way.  One of the items that impressed me was an issue with an exhaust vent we moved from the sidewall through the roof.  They patched up the hole and found some old paint in my garage and painted it over without prompting. That’s going above and beyond!\nAnother impressive measure was the dust control.  This was a huge renovation in the middle of our house.  As mentioned, Jake put up plastic to control it but a few times when they were sanding the drywall they grabbed our floor mop and whipped up the floor in a walkway area all without asking.  Things like this just made me feel like they cared for the work they were doing. We were not only happy with the work but able to function in our home despite the mess as it was all being worked on.\nThe work that Jake did was fantastic.  Everything is neat, clean and professional looking.  I really have no complaints at all.  As we are “moving in” I am looking things over to see if there are any punch list items to address.  I have no issues to add to a punch list and am so happy with this long-awaited project that I plan to use J. Henry exclusively on any remaining projects in my house.  Because of the level of communication, quality of work and speed of progress I highly recommend J. Henry Construction to anyone looking for a contractor.  This is undoubtedly a 5 out of 5 star review."

He csne highly recommended and I'd seen his work in our neighborhood so thought I'd try the company out. He doesn't cut corners and is a bit of a perfectionist which in this case only benefits ME! 😄 I would recommend him to anyone looking for inside or outside work. While I had my kitchen and bathroom done by him,  my neighbors deck done by him looks amazing! Thanks Jake!"

Mr. Ron has done exceptional work in repairing a hole in the ceiling a plumber cut out to fix a pin hole leak and assisting me with two entry door repairs. One door was rotting out from the inside on the bottom and wasn't sealing well when shut. He fashioned a replacement out of a piece of 2x4 and had everything aligned perfectly. Installing the bottom sweep was now possible because of his work. The next door ended up having a more serious issue and requires the door, frame and all, to be removed from the wall. Door now shuts and seals perfectly and it looks like it was never removed from the wall in the first place.\n\nI almost didn't want to write a review because part of me wants to monopolize his skills! Another thing is his communication. He always communicated with me on all repairs whether I was there in person or was away due to work. He sends photos of his progress as well which I really appreciated since I didn't get that with anyone else I've contracted work out with.\n\nHis pricing is very fair and I'd encourage anyone who works with him to sweeten the pot if you can when the good job is done. He's also one guy, so if you're able I encourage folks help him with heavy lifting. It'll make the job go by faster and he will appreciate the assistance which shows through is work and attention to detail.

The quality of his workmanship speaks volumes about his dedication to excellence, but what really set him apart was his patience and willingness to to address all my inquiries.\n\nIn summary,  I can't recommend S&S Plumbing Service highly enough.

They were able to fit me into the schedule several days sooner than anyone else I talked with, and they were helpful to inform me of known and unknown potential expenses. When the details of a home warranty company came into play, they gave me some input and time to sort out the specifics in order to minimize the cost I had to bear. Nicholas even gave me some great guidance without hesitation on a few smaller plumbing projects I hoped to undertake by myself in the future. When dealing with something as important as water lines, I would much rather hire someone who does quality work than someone who just \"gets it done\" for cheap. Nevertheless, I felt like their service was a solid value and would absolutely call them again. The peace of mind of knowing a licensed pro completed the job and will stand by their work is worth a LOT. I would absolutely recommend S&S and Nicholas especially."

These additional touches weren't part of the service, but Nicholas quickly offered (without our asking) to replace and seal these fixtures as merely part of his visit. After trying other, bigger-name plumbing companies in the area, S&S was clearly the winner. Do yourself a favor and hire these plumbers if you want the job done thoroughly, correctly, and without a price tag that'll make you faint."
