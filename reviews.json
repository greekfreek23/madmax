Shawn and another person that was with him, called the morning of the appointment, was on time, and took care of it with no problems. After they finished, they asked me to go inside and flush the commodes to be sure the problem with the sluggish flushes were gone. They were! This company is EXCELLENT! My yard was completely the same as before they came. They made sure to cover the ground up just as it was before. There were no marks left in yard, which is great! The guys even gave me advice to do every few months to help aid the break down of the waste in the septic. They were both very professional and respectful! This will be my go to company and I will recommend them at any given chance! Awesome customer service and a fair price for my job needed. Just a great experience from start to finish!  Thank you, 3rd Generation Septic!!"
