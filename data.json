He worked hard to locate a part needed two days before Christmas and succeeded. He showed up earlier than promised, was friendly and very thorough. He was determined to find the root of the problem and provide a solution to have our home back up and running for Christmas with our family. I can?t recommend him enough for your plumbing/ sewer problems. We will definitely reach out to him for any future needs.",

From start to finish, they were incredibly professional, kind, and efficient. The quality of their workmanship is top-notch, and they treated my yard with the utmost care, leaving it as they found it. Remarkably, they even took the time to meticulously restore the grass where they had to dig, leaving no trace of their work behind and you can hardly tell I had my waterline replaced. I highly recommend CJ Plumbing to anyone in need of plumbing services. They truly went above and beyond for me.\n\nAnyone looking for a plumber, I highly recommend giving CJ a call.",

He got on the phone and told us what we could do prior to him coming out to mitigate any more damage. He got to house around 330 and had everything he needed to replace and/or fix the problem. After asking for his professional opinion, we decided to go ahead and replace the water heater. Keep in mind, it?s now 430ish on a Friday afternoon. He said he would rather go ahead and start the job as opposed to waiting until Monday. In his words, ?I don?t want to leave you with a ticking time bomb.?  The entire job took about four hours to complete. Carter didn?t leave the house until 9 or so when it was all said and done.\n\nI don?t know of many companies that would have done what Carter did. He is professional, courteous, clean, and more importantly, trustworthy. I have ZERO issues in using CJ Plumbing and Gas again or referring them to friends and family.",

He not only found a rare part for my shower due to old pipes but made sure to give me the part info should I ever need another, but his company also came out to my house two days after Christmas to fix a busted pipe as planned but they also fixed my sink as well that they were not told about during the call and showed no irritation with this.

He even replaced some pvc on our pool pump! Sims gave a lot of great advice along the way and helped us overcome several obstacles in our remodeling.

I have not only received high quality work with top tier customer service but LT Drain and Small Repair also deliver the best for a fair price. I?m quite sure everyone has experienced a business that will take advantage of the customer and attempt to hustle said customer into unnecessary costs. Paul has done 2 jobs for me so far and the 3rd job I requested was an unnecessary one. Instead of taking advantage of me, he let me know what caused the issue and he assured me the 2nd job would take care of said issue. He knows his industry and it turns out that his advice was spot on! Not only has he earned my business but he has also earned my trust! I won?t do business with anyone else in the industry and I am so thankful to have found them!!!",

We initially were going to have our ceiling damage repaired by a guy our friends recommended, but the quote he gave was way over the top and included items we didn?t want fixed.

Anthony was extremely skilled and matched our ceiling pattern perfectly within 2 hours (he patched about a 8x16 foot hole and plastered it). John and his assistant were back out to seal the water stains and paint our ceilings as soon as the plaster dried?they were quick and were able to not drip any ceiling paint on any of our brand new floors, which we certainly would not have been able to do ourselves!\n\nOverall, great customer service, quick repairs,  and great cost!

I knew before the very first call to Tristan that the clogged toilet was old and probably just needed to be replaced. But when I had to call him a second time to come unclog the toilet, I knew that it was just time to replace it. I talked to him about installing a new toilet, got a quote, and expected to have to wait at least a week or more before he would be able to get back out to put in the new toilet, but nope!

He also discovered our fill lines were done for, and set things for them to be moved, file permits, and make things so simple for us!\nHim, and his helper, were freakin' amazing!\nAnd the price!

The owner Scott came out with his camera to check my sewer line and found it was holding water and was probably clogged. The piping was at least 40 years old, so I asked them to replace it with new.\n\nThe next day (7/15/21) the secretary called and scheduled the work for the 19th. The weather was not very good but Joe and his helper arrived early and got right to work. Their knowledge, experience, and work ethic were top notch. They worked hard and continued even when the rain arrived and lasted for a few hours. They finished up and cleaned up very well, even with lots of water and mud to deal with.\n\nI would recommend this family owned and operated company to anyone.",

During the pool Dig the one line was found unfortunately . I called Scott's that day and Joe called me within minutes of the call to the office. He told me he would be out the next afternoon at a certain time . The following day he showed up at the exact time as promised . He went over all repair options and gave his expert opinion which was willing to cater to budget and our needs. He was up front about everything and was not just trying to make a sale to us . We decided we would go ahead with an entirely new system . He called that evening and started the permit process , And followed up with me to let me know when he expected to be out and as soon as the permit was approved. He and the crew showed up exactly the date and time for the install and finished earlier than my expectations and for the price he quoted with no up charges like some companies tend to do. He also went a step further and moved an old propane tank around for me. If I could give a higher rating than 5 stars I absolutely would. I have always been a do it myself person because that is my nature. That being said Scott's has gained a customer for life and I will promote them to anyone.",

The guys came, did the job, even stayed late, cleaned up & made me happy. Then I got the bill, and kept smiling. With getting ready to remodel I had no qualms on who to call. They've been to my house several times over the past months installing a water heater, helping with all the plumbing needs to remodel my bathroom and even helped hunt down a false leak, gratis (broken water jug).

He was at my home around 6 that same day.  I did not expect that.  He had to redo the plumbing for the dishwasher as it was all wrong and had to take out the wood floor there to get the new one to fit.  The newer dishwashers are way different then the old ones.   It was so a relief having this young man come to our aide.   I will call him for future plumbing issues and will recommend him to others as well.

My husband checked the piping downstairs and discovered that one joint had come completely unsealed and was also leaking into the basement. Jeremy said he would be here the next morning. Not only was he on time, he was actually a bit early. He immediately got to work. He thought initially the septic tank might need pumped, however, on further inspection,  the pipe in the basement had come loose from what was holding it up properly and was now sitting at a downward angle. It wasn't allowing everything to pass through and thus there was a huge clog. Jeremy soon had everything cleaned out, that section of pipe replaced and resealed, and mounted back to the wall properly. He was extremely professional, courteous and I will most definitely call him again should I need anything in the future.\nThank you Jeremy!",

We highly recommend Muddy Buddy?s and will call them in the future for our plumbing needs!",

We?re new in the area and didn?t know who to call so we reached out again to the Muddy Buddy crew. At first, Glenda patiently walked me through via phone in finding a solution, but when that didn?t work, Guy dropped his morning plans to help solve our lawn irrigation problem (even though this was not a standard plumbing service). These awesome folks didn?t have to respond on a Sunday morning, but they did and I?m just continually amazed by the people we?ve interacted with here in Huntsville AL, most especially Guy and Glenda for their above and beyond sincerity, and customer care. I know this might be saying much, but these are truly good folks and I have no hesitation referring family and friends to them. Thank you once again guys, proud to say we?re your new lifelong customers?and friends!!",

The pipe was busted under the concrete so Muddy Buddy had to reroute the pipe to another location. A different company came out before and obviously damaged the pipe while trying to get it to drain, and then they did an estimate to reroute the pipes just in case it needed it. Obviously, it needed it after the pipe wall was busted at the first turn. Their price climbed to over $2k in less than 10 minutes by adding in other pipes and parts that had to be replaced (but didnt need to be replaced). Muddy Buddy did the job that needed to be done without replacing good pipes in a few hours that the other company said would take a week, and Muddy Buddy did the job for 1/3 of the price of the other company's estimate and didnt add in other pipes, parts, and days of labor just to make a buck. Good old fashioned service without trying to rip off their customers.",

They did so good I had them check some other plumbing things and found out work previously was done improperly and explained exactly what and why it was this way. I called the other company and asked them why and when I explained it to them they didn?t have an answer and wanted to come back out to my house and redo the work properly. I said \"NO\" and called Muddy Buddy back and gave them the work which in turn they fixed everything wrong immediately and at an affordable price. Highly recommend this Company.

I was told that any plumbing service could inspect and provide the clearance letter needed for selling the home. Thanks to my realtor for doing the leg work and calling different plumbing companies, he gave me Delta's number, and because I had used them in the past I felt comfortable scheduling the inspection for my father's home.\n\nCalling and speaking with Ms. Opal to set up the appointment went without a hitch as she was so very courteous and took the time to answer my questions and was very detailed in the information that she needed as well as the work that would be performed. She even sent a follow up email to let me know that she received my signed authorization form that I emailed back to her....I didn't even have to call and ask....WOW.\n\nThe pleasant experience didn't stop there, Mr. Trace called me once he arrived to the property and then called me back to let me know the results of the inspection. Because I was out of town taking care of my mother, Mr. Trace could have told me anything, but yet he was honest to confirm that the tank was in very good condition and didn't need any service.\n\nThank you to both Ms. Opal and Mr. Trace for your awesome customer service, your attention to detail, and keeping the customer top of mind!! Awesome!",

We had a serious plumbing and called Delta and they were here very quickly since it was an emergency and we didn't want out brand new floor and bathroom ruined because of the back up that was caused from 64 year old cast iorn pipes rusting and breaking apart.    They were here 2 days assessing the job, was here early in the day Wednesday and started the job.  Every piece of dirt was put back into place.....lol .......and the made special care of not tearing up a new baby tree that had just been planted recently.  They doubled checked the water to make sure it was running threw the new pipes properly, had me run water threw the washing machine several times so that everything was flowing correctly and not backing up again.  The speediness and care they gave me was top notch.  Everything they had to do or needed to do they told me first and asked if i wanted to do it and yes we did it.  And I couldn't be happier.  In the past we have used several different plumbers but no one has ever taken the time to explain everything to us and give us the option as to what we wanted to do, and give me the respect I deserve being that its our house and our money.  No pressure or pushing us into a decision we needed to think about it and go over with him on.   I totally recommend Delta Plumbing for any and all plumbing problems they would be the one's I'd call and \"will\" call.  Thank you Jacob for your help, your kindness and concern of what could have happened in the very near future had we not had all those pipes replaced.  Thank you Delta",

He fixed the problem promptly and even gave me a few pointers to help me prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nI've seen a few bad reviews from people based on their \"home warranty\" and their repair not being covered.  Whether you dispatch a plumber, electrician, or AC specialist, they can only cover items that your home warranty company lets them cover, based on your contract (that you picked).  People should read their contracts first before taking their frustrations out on a local business.  Cheaper home warranties cover less items, go figure.",

This was the one big aggravating factor. Other than that, there's only a few more things I'd suggest. Buy Booties that you can pull over your shoes. If you've been under a house, in a protective suit, wearing booties inside would cut down on cleanup. Other than this they were GREAT! I'll use them on my next issue if anything comes up.",

Ron?s time in the plumbing industry, relationships, and time in the community make him an invaluable resource.  Over the past several months and especially during COVID shortages he has provided what seems to be an invaluable resource and that is peace of mind.  I can ask him to resolve anything from replacing a garbage disposal to fixing a fireplace (gas pipe) without having to follow-up with him.  He gets the job done, often goes beyond expectation, and is quick to communicate?even when he just got out of the hospital.

We had heard great things about their work and professionalism and after reading such high reviews we did not even get a second bid. With reviews like that we knew they had to be doing a great job at what they do. Our job was dirt work over existing field lines and laying drainage pipe from our gutters to divert water from our house. Drew was the young man sent to do our work and all I can say is WOW, what a nice person he is. He is a perfectionist at his job and strives to do his best work for you and wants you to be pleased with the work you are paying for.

The first problem everyone told me I needed a new pump and It couldn't  be repaired. M & M came out and repaired the pump because it just had something wrapped up in the pump saving me hundreds. The next issue, others said we needed a new pump and I called M & M they came out and found my breaker went bad. I will never call another when I have an issue again. They are the most honest, always professional and polite, get to the root of the problem, and find the best solution saving home owners money.",

The two techs that came out were very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Couple of genuinely good guys. They didn't mind me watching (it was legit cool to watch), and asking questions, always taking the time to answer any questions and give me solid advice on taking care of the septic system. They were able to raise and lower the concrete septic lid with a feather touch using the backhoe (impressive!) and cleaned everything up nicely. And the price I was quoted on the phone was exactly what I paid, not a penny more. I had always heard horror stories about septic service and dreaded the day, but with the excellent price and awesome service, Ikard Septic made it a breeze. Call these guys first when you need septic service. I highly recommend them!!",
