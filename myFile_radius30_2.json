          "text": "Worse experience ever! Had issue with my garage after his crew left from doing drywall project . I contacted him to let him know my garage was not opening and could one of his guys maybe touched something by accident since he was working in the area . He immediately got offended and said that was impossible. He started over talking me as I was trying to explain to him that I just got my garage doors repaired a couple of months ago and had no problem with it until today. Then he proceeded to ask me to give him the name of person that repaired my garage as if I was lying . Then told me what he did for me was for free. He ended up getting cursed out because he thought he could talk to me any kind of way and kept over talking me as if I was trying to get free services. Told me it was free and he would take it as a loss and he wasn\u2019t hurting for nothing. He lied and said I cursed his crew out and I was nothing but nice to them . He sent his crew back to my home and told them to collect their things and they weren\u2019t coming back the next day . Starting bragging about they were the top crew in the area and yet left my home a mess. He told me he didn\u2019t need my money and they would move on . I asked him how much do I owe him and he said nothing and I can pay him if I felt like it. Unbelievable!  Most arrogant person I\u2019ve ever met. Kept changing his prices . Text me and told me to make sure I put in reviews that I cursed him out and it didn\u2019t cost me anything. This guy is a piece of work . He got back exactly what he gave me. Good luck with this one . Mind you I have all of the text messages. Also, he tried to make his texts sound professional but his conversation over the phone was rude , loud and arrogant. I\u2019m sure there are other business that provide excellent services. You got back what you gave to me. Nothing but a Wolfe in sheep\u2019s clothing. Lesson learned. Make sure you get everything in writing before you deal with this guy. He just throws out prices . Since you told me my services was free and you will count is as a loss, so be it .

She decided to blame us for her garage door not working when we are doing Sheetrock repairs and weren\u2019t even using or touching the garage door or its components. She said it was fixed 3 months prior and I find her the next day I wound take a look at it and if u couldn\u2019t figure it out if she\u2019d give me the number of repair guy I\u2019d see if he could help me figure out the problem. She started screaming and cussing me from that point. Everything above is a complete lie. She called me racist which is the sign of a weak person today. I didn\u2019t take a dollar from her nor still haven\u2019t. She is a liar, Incompetent and a fool. I do not take it lightly reviewing me with dishonesty. I am thankful I run a business with operating funds set aside\n so I can HAPPILY leave awful people like this with no payment. I have no regrets for leaving this job and wish it didn\u2019t  even taken this job. No contractor should ever put up with someone so horrible. I have zero respect for her. I run a business with respect and reputation and should\u2019ve never set foot in this house. Do not ever lie to people about my company ever again ",

While he was checking on the trim job I asked him if he knew someone for a cabinet job not knowing he also did that as well. From start to finish Slade was a man of his word unlike multiple other Montgomery contractors who I have been burned by. He made it clear to expect some touch up needed and until I was satisfied he sent his crew everyday until it was up to my standards. He also tried to save me money with different ways of doing things which is unheard of which I truly appreciated. I will be using him for all my jobs going forward and he is a gem for this area. Thank you Slade and his team for a great job.",

          "text": "Hired them to do a drywall repair on a ceiling. He took the job knowing it was a stomp texture. After the repair, the tenants of the home sent us pictures showing the repair which appeared to be low quality and the texture was not even similar. I understand it won't be exact, but this isn't even close. We contacted him and he said he would go out and do a better job with the texture and he asked us to go ahead and pay him. We paid him and now he won't return our calls or texts and of course has not went back out to do the job correctly. I guess I should have read the other review on here talking about how he will ghost you as soon as he is paid. The attached picture will show you the level of quality you should expect from this business.\n\nedit: We called you and left a message and after 12 days got no reply. The tenant called you three separate times and left messages and got no reply. The tenants are given the option to schedule service since it is their schedule we need to work around. We of course find and pay for services. I paid you because you promised you would go fix the repair you made. I have text messages to prove that you asked for payment prior to going back out and completing the repair. I appreciate that you found the time to interact after a negative review, I just wish it was sooner and on better terms. Your response to this review was harsh and I find it insulting to be called a liar and a shame. I should have read the other negative reviews so I could see how you talk to your clients. I hope that consumers will be able to see the way you respond to unhappy customers. Just look at the picture to see what quality to expect and look at how he responds to see what type of interaction you might expect.",

I called her and had no answer and haven\u2019t heard anything back since. I have no problem coming back to re texture. I just haven\u2019t had the ok or communication from tenant. Also leaving a bad review and saying I took your money is unfair and a outright lie. I wish you would call me directly. I  sent you photos upon completion and you paid willingly. I also didn\u2019t take any money upfront and completed job before you paid anything. This is unmerited and you leaving the scheduling up to your tenant who didn\u2019t respond or answer if very unprofessional. I am very disappointed in how customers use reviews to try to hurt contractors lively hood. I am ever more becoming more of a believer in very very bad customers than contractors. This review is a shame to you.\n\nEdit: in regard to the edited review above, I do not believe that customers are always right and that contractors have the obligation to make you happy or whatever you think is supposed to happen. The review above was a lie and I will not let people think it\u2019s true. I also just spoke with you because you asked me to call you and you insinuated that I left a insulting comment back on here. Nothing on here is an insult but rather a response back. You also hung up in my face and asked have I graduated high school? I don\u2019t even understand what that was for. I do hope customers read this and know that we will not be bullied or harassed by individuals. I can share the message we\u2019re I offered to go back the very next morning and you guys told me I couldn\u2019t and had the tenant try to schedule and that\u2019s when everything got mishandled. I also jumped on this project quickly for you guys to repair it. To sum up this whole ordeal for any person reading these reviews is that we responded quickly to this customer to do the repairs. The stomp texture was not satisfying and we offered to go back the very next morning to fix it. The customer said the tenant had plans and they would get in touch with us. I Tried to schedule the repair for Thursday of this week and they informed me that because I replied to their review they felt insulted and not comfortable for me to come back to that property. This gentleman got on here and has insinuated that I take money and run and it\u2019s in no way true as you can see with 70+ other perfect reviews the problem is not with Price Handyman Services but with a couple bad Apple customers. I do not apologize for replying and letting you know this and I hope that other contractors also do not get bullied by customers by false reviews to cause harm to their business",

Called me back promptly with a price, what materials they would use and approximate time to do it. Scheduled them for the next day. However, they had a cancellation and asked if they could come that day to do the work. Showed up with 15 minutes of that call and got right to the demolition and repairs.  I needed to have the fascia board on the back of my house replaced and an exterior door frame fixed from water damage. They replaced the fascia board with MiraTech which has a much longer life than wood.  Work was completed within a few hours and it looks great! Their team is definitely someone I would recommend for any repairs that you are needing. Price was super good and their professionalism was too notch.",

Above all other competitors, this business was polite, responsive, and on point with their skill, expertise, and timeliness. I asked for dry wall repair and painting. Not only did they complete the job in ONE DAY they went above and beyond what I asked for to take care of my rental property, complete with photos and full transparency. This guy answered all my calls. My property managers were impressed too. Complete trust was built between us; they did an outstanding job AND I'm certainly going back to them again next summer when new tenants move in.",

They got to work installing as soon as my tile came in - no waiting around and hoping - in fact, he was ready to start BEFORE my tile came in, as soon as I contacted him!  They showed up on time, and did a dream job on my bedroom floor installing large slate tiles.  I have recommended him and his crew at my workplace as someone to use as well and they are on our list of people to call!  No contractor nightmares here!  They will earn their money and your business and do right by you!  I plan to hire them to work on my bathroom remodel next.  I am extremely particular about quality of work on my home, and they lived up to my expectations!",

They got no paint on the brick of the house and it looks brand new. They  even painted the garage door. The owner stated they were starting a power wash business as well and quoted me a price for my driveway and stone walkway. They pressure washed my driveway and walkway and it looks just like the concrete's been poured. What a face lift. They started at 8:00 a.m. and finished by 4:30. I highly recommend them",

You have called my home builder organization and was given no attention because you are lying. The sad thing is that I can\u2019t post screen shots on here of he and his wife to show his lies and her allowing him to. Anyone who reads all my other reviews will see how out of line this is. I have had 3 perfect reviews since this guy. The short of this story is that I tried to help this angry little man out because they were in a bind, there house is on wildwood in McGhee Allendale neighborhood and they were literally having to close on the house in a week and were still in full disarray from remodeling everything and nothing was done or even close to being done. They changed the entire scope of work during the job. I raised the price to adjust and he called me and said he couldn\u2019t afford it. I made him bring me my money Friday morning, I told him we would work all day that day and wherever we got to by the end of the day would be where we stopped. He brought my money that morning because I told him I wanted it before we painted that day, he brought it and we painted all day as agreed. When we left that evening apparently forgot everything we discussed and began to text me about finishing the paint job. Originally scope was 3300 for just spraying wall and ceilings in 3 bedrooms, living room and dining. He asked us not to come Wednesday because he had multiple people going to be in and out that day and didn\u2019t was everyone on top of each other and brought trim guy in and ran all crown molding, all base board. Set 10 plus doors with jamb and casings. I told him the new price would be $6600. He called me and talked all nice then and informed me he couldn\u2019t afford that after we had basically done it all. I didn\u2019t get mad with him because I still wanted to help him and his wife out, he said all he had was $4000. I don\u2019t know what personal problems this guy has going in but I can assure you that he got a full paint job for  $4000 . I got screwed on this job, not him. He is just angry and I don\u2019t know why. It could be because he continues to see us In his neighborhood working every week for actual classy good customers who can afford to pay for work they want done. So thank you Josh for leaving a review on here where I could actually comment back instead of Facebook where you locked the comments to where I couldn\u2019t reply. I hope you and your wife are enjoying your newly painted home that you didn\u2019t pay for in its entirety.",

We were happy with it and hired him for the job. Several times I\u2019ve reached out to see when he plans on doing the job. Most times he hasn\u2019t responded and when he has, he\u2019s said he plans to start the next week.

There was a lot going on but they started when Slade said they would and were finished where he said they would be.  The work is very professional, looks great and was done in a timely manner. We will be using Price Handyman Services for ALL of our future home remodeling! I highly recommend them!",

We had thought we might have to purchase a new door.\nSlade assessed the damage and knew immediately what had to be done and  advised that he could repair the door using a sanding and painting technique.  He took pictures and later returned with a paint chart so we could select a color.\nThis was a 3-day process.  He was always on time and called prior to his arrival as we had requested. He was very professional and explained exactly what he was doing at each step of the process.  He was meticulous and took the necessary time to ensure the work was done properly.  Slade stands by his work.\nThe completed product was outstanding. We intend to ask him to return in the future regarding other projects.",

I contacted 3 contractors for bids. 2 of the contractors wanted to replace the facia boards ( which did not need to be done). This put the other contractors bids over $2000. Slade came in and was honest and repaired on what was needed. Which in the end saved me a lot of money. Very professional and excellent work. Could not have found a better group of guys. I will call them again for sure. Thank you Slade and family for a job well done.",

They painted three bathroom walls and all the cabinets. All electrical plates in the house were replaced and some with GFI. All countertops in the kitchen and bathrooms were replaced with quartz. They installed new plumbing in the kitchen and bathrooms. The kitchen sink was replaced with a stainless steel 60/40 and installed a new garbage disposal. We had our fireplace painted and thoroughly pleased with it. He painted our shutters and entry door. To say we are pleased is an understatement.",

It involved stripping off the old wallpaper, prepping and repairing walls as needed, and painting our large bathroom.  He stripped and refinished all cabinets and installed all new hardware.  We very much appreciated his total attention to his work, his timely communication with us and his opinion when asked.  We found his work to be very satisfactory and would not hesitate to recommend him for similar work.\n\nDon & Carmela Binns",

Slade did interior paint for us at our new house. He and his team were wonderful - very professional, punctual, cleaned after each day, and the house looks great!  They helped us with color choices and I would highly recommend them to anyone. We will definitely use them for all our painting/handyman needs in the future!   FIVE STARS!!",
